However many different systems are possible.  Some examples include:\n\n* A spicy tolerance bar, where eating enough spicy foods will grant a permanent resistance to fire.\n* A zombie simulation where you must eat brains to avoid negative effects.\n* Gluten intolerance.  Eat bread, get sick.\n\nWhen updating the mod, please delete your `/config/nutrition/nutrients/` directory to receive new mod support.  This is necessary so we don't overwrite any customizations.\n\n## Mods Supported\n\nMods that are supported with the default five-food group system include:\n\n*

  "language": "Jupyter Notebook",
  "readme_contents": "\n# off-nutrition-table-extractor\nThis repository is the accumulation of all the work done during Google Summer of Code 2018.\n- **Student**: Sagar Panchal\n- **Github**: [sgrpanchal31](https://github.com/sgrpanchal31)\n- **Organisation**: [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)\n- **Project**: [OCR on Nutritional Facts Table](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6627107531128832)\n\n## Technical Details\nThe pipeline is made up of three major parts namely table detection, text detection and OCR with post-processing.\n\n### Table Detection\nFor detecting tables in an image, we are using the Single Shot Detector (SSD) object detection model. The model is trained on Tensorflow's Object Detection API. The provided Jupyter Notebook shows how we are using the pre-trained graph to detect tables in product images.\nBefore running the notebook, install the object detection model from the [Tensorflow's Github Repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models).\n![Table detection](/data/images/table_detection.jpeg)\n\n### Text Detection and extraction\nText detection is done using the [text-detection-ctpn](https://github.com/eragonruan/text-detection-ctpn) which uses fast-rcnn to extract textual regions in the image. In future, we are planning to update it to a faster and more accurate text detection model.\n![Text Detection](/data/images/text_detection.jpg)\n\n### OCR and post-processing\nFor the text recognition, we are using Tesseract OCR. Every text box detected from the text detection step will be passed through the OCR and a raw string will be returned which is then passed throught many post processing steps that clean the string (through regular expressions) and rectify any spelling mistakes in the string (using the [symspell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell) spelling correction algorithm).\n\n### Final Results\n![Full pipeline detection](/data/images/final_result.jpg)\nOutput for the above image is given below:\n```\nNutritional content = {\n    'Dietary Fiber': (2.0, 'g'), \n    'Sugars': (9.0, 'g'),\n    'Soluble Fiber': (1.0, 'g'), \n    'Monounsaturated Fat': (0.5, 'g'), \n    'Polyunsaturated Fat': (0.5, 'g'), \n    'Trans Fat': (0.0, 'g'), \n    'Other Carbohydrate': (11.0, 'g')\n}\n```\n\n## Requirements\nThe code is compatible with Python 3.0+. If you find any other dependency required during the execution, do raise an issue and inform there. \n```\n1. Tensorflow\n2. OpenCV\n3. Pillow\n4. Numpy\n5. Tesseract v4.0\n6. Pytesseract\n7. Django-2.0.5 (Only for API)\n```\n\n## How to test your image\n- Download the frozen model for ctpn from [here](https://github.com/eragonruan/text-detection-ctpn/releases/download/untagged-48d74c6337a71b6b5f87/ctpn.pb).\n- Save the model in `./nutrition_extractor/data` repository.\n- Make a directory named `test_images` and put the images in that folder.\n- run `python detection.py -i [IMAGE-PATH]` from inside nutrition_extractor folder.\n\n## Planned functionality\n- [x] Develop a table detection model to extract the region of interest (nutritional facts table) from images.\n- [x] Crop the RoI from images and apply text detection pipeline to the region.\n- [x] Pass every text blob through Tesseract OCR to extract the text.\n- [x] Develop a post-processing method to clean the text and extract the nutritional label and its value form it.\n- [ ] Create a spatial mapping algorithm to map the text blobs according to their location in the image. (Done but the accuracy is not upto the standards).\n\n## Future Work\nWith GSoC 2018 being the kickstarter of this project, we are just getting started. There are a lot of things to do that we are going to do\n* Improving the spatial mapping algorithm. \n* Training and using a faster and more accurate text detection model than the currently used fast-rcnn model.\n* Creating a bigger nutritional table dataset and training that on a recent and bleeding edge object detection model to improve the accuracy.\n* Developing a better image preprocessing algorithm to detect bold text.\n* Implementing a method to unify the two models into one since the same calculations are being done twice in initial layers of the two models.\n"

  "readme_contents": "## active_nutrition\n\nActiveNutrition is an ActiveRecord-backed collection of models for storing and retrieving nutritional information from the USDA's Nutrient Database.\n\n## Installation\n\n`gem install active_nutrition`\n\n## Usage\n\nActiveNutrition is meant to be used within a Rails application, but it should work within any Ruby project that uses ActiveRecord 3.0 or greater.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'active_nutrition'\n```\n\nIn a (possibly Rails) gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'active_nutrition', '~> 0.5.0'\n```\n\n### Getting the Data\n\nActiveNutrition has the ability to fetch the current Nutrient Database files from the USDA's website and load them into your ActiveRecord-supported database.  As long as you've established a connection via ActiveRecord, you should be able to import the nutrient data.\n\nWith Rails:\n\n```bundle exec rake active_nutrition:migrate active_nutrition:rebuild```\n\nWithout Rails:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'active_nutrition'\n\nActiveNutrition.migrate\nActiveNutrition.rebuild\n```\n\n_Note_: The full data import could take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours depending on how powerful your computer is.\n_Note_: You can use `an` instead of `active_nutrition` for all rake tasks, eg. `rake an:rebuild`.\n\n### Searching\n\nActiveNutrition provides a simple `#search` method that executes a SQL `LIKE` statement and returns an array of `Food` objects:\n\n```ruby\nActiveNutrition.search(\"olive oil\")\n```\n\n### Food Objects\n\nEach `Food` object offers these methods\n\n1.  `#nutrition_facts`: Returns an array of `NutritionFact` objects for each kind of nutrient associated with this food.  Examples include the amount of protein, fat, and sodium.  Each `NutritionFact` object knows its unit (eg. miligrams, grams, etc) and amount per 1 gram of the food.\n2.  `#weights`: Returns an array of common unit weights for this food (eg. cups, tablespoons, etc) and their gram equivalents.\n3.  `#food_group`: Returns an object that specifies the name and code of the food's food group (eg. Breads, Vegetables, etc).\n\n### NutritionFact Objects\n\nEach `NutritionFact` object has these important methods:\n\n1.  `#value`: How much of this nutrient is present in 1 gram of the food.\n2.  `#units`: The unit associated with `#value`.\n3.  `#description`: A textual description of the nutrient.\n\n```ruby\nActiveNutrition.search(\"olive oil\").first.nutrition_facts\n```\n\nCalling `#nutrition_facts` on a `Food` object actually returns an instance of `NutritionFacts`, which provides a handy `#to_hash` convenience method to hash nutrient amounts by description:\n\n```ruby\n# { \"Protein\" => 0.0, \"Total lipid (fat)\" => 100.0, ... }\nActiveNutrition.search(\"olive oil\").first.nutrition_facts.to_hash\n```\n\nThe `#to_hash` method is capable of hashing nutrient amounts by any method supported by `NutritionFact` via the `:by` option:\n\n```ruby\n# { 203 => 0.0, 204 => 100.0, 205 => 0.0, 207 => 0.0, ... }\nActiveNutrition.search(\"olive oil\").first.nutrition_facts.to_hash(:by => :nutrition_number)\n```\n\n### Weight Objects\n\nEach `Weight` object offers these methods:\n\n1.  `#amount`: The amount associated with `#measurement`, eg. 1, 0.5, etc.\n2.  `#measurement`: The unit associated with `#amount`, eg. cup, tablespoon, gallon, dash, etc.\n3.  `#grams`: Mass in grams.\n\nCalling `#weights` on a `Food` object actually returns an instance of `Weights`, which provides a handy `#to_hash` convenience method to hash weights (grams) by measurement:\n\n```ruby\n# { \"tablespoon\" => 13.5, \"cup\" => 216.0, \"tsp\" => 4.5 }\nActiveNutrition.search(\"olive oil\").first.weights.to_hash\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nNo external requirements.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nNo test suite exists for this gem yet - coming soon!\n\n\n## Authors\n\nCameron C.

  "readme_contents": "\n===================================\nPrice And Nutrition Tracking System\n===================================\n\nNote for Current Users - DB Changes when Upgrading\n==================================================\n\nChanges to the database schema have been made recently (2020-04-13)\nand when upgrading from older versions you will need to migrate your\ndatabase by running './manage.py migrate' - see the \"Schema Changes\"\nsubsection below for more details.\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nPANTS is a self-hosted, open-source nutrition tracker and a tool for\nnutritional data analysis of ingredients and recipes. It can be run on\nyour own computer or as a multiuser web service (e.g. for use by a\ndietician/trainer/researcher and their clients).\n\nAs well as tracking daily calories etc, PANTS is designed to make it\neasy to compare and optimize recipes which form a regular part of your\ndiet; a key feature is the ability for recipes to be components of\nother recipes.\n\nFor example a dough recipe and a filling recipe can both be components\nin a pie recipe; you can clone the pie recipe with alternate fillings\nto compare the nutritional values of the alternatives. Any changes to\nthe dough recipe will be reflected in the data for all of the pies.\nThese \"meta-recipes\" can also be used to provide an \"average\"\nbreakfast/lunch/snack/etc for meal and diet planning.\n\nPANTS is under active, daily use by the author so updates should be\nfairly frequent. On the other hand, the code tends to be quick and\ndirty as new things get added because the author wanted to use them\nASAP while cooking his dinner.\n\nIt is currently not recommended for non-technical users; basic\nfamiliarity with Django is useful.\n\n.. contents:: Contents:\n   :backlinks: none\n\nUse Cases\n=========\n\nIn particular PANTS is designed for:\n\n- Tracking the calories and other nutrients in your food, especially things cooked frequently.\n- Storing a list of recipes, and determining the cost and nutritional values of a recipe. This includes recipes which are used in other recipes (recursively) e.g. a dough recipe and a filling recipe can both be components in a pie recipe.\n- Comparing the cost and nutritional values of different ingredients or recipes (e.g. \"What food has the most protein-per-dollar?\", \"Which of these recipes has the least calories but is still high in fibre?\").\n- Long term dietary planning - working out which ingredients or recipes you want to include regularly in your diet, based on cost and other factors.\n\nPANTS is *not* ideal for:\n\n- Tracking takeaway/restaraunt meals or prepackaged snack foods (rather than stuff you prepare yourself from basic ingredients)\n- Determing the best place to buy a shopping list of items (cost is not designed to be updated regularly or automatically, it is there for long-term planning).\n- Comparing the cost of ingredients across different regions.\n\nOverview and Features\n=====================\n\nThere are 4 basic sections of the system:\n\nIngredients\n   Generic ingredients, like \"Rolled Oats\", \"Green Split Peas\",\n   \"Skim Milk\", not any particular brand or store.\n   You can compare relative data such as Protein per Joule or Fibre per\n   Dollar on the ingredients pages.\n\nRecipes\n   A collection of ingredients and/or other recipes, showing the combined\n   nutritional value and cost of each serve of the recipe, as well as the relative\n   per-calorie and per-dollar values.\n\nDiary\n   Record of food intake; compares the total to your target and also\n   shows how much each food contributed to your total for the time\n   period.\n\nTargets\n   Minimum and Maximum nutritional and cost values you are aiming to\n   reach each day. As well as daily targets you can also set targets\n   for particular meals (e.g. a pre/post workout meal), or special days.\n\nSome example screenshots can be seen at https://github.com/dylanleigh/PriceAndNutritionTrackingSystem/tree/master/screenshots\n\nOther Feature Notes and Tips\n----------------------------\n\nTagging\n   Ingredients and recipes can be given multiple tags for easier searching and\n   analysis; this makes it much easier to (for example) compare the fibre\n   per calorie in different vegetables or the calories per serve of\n   different dessert.\n\n   Recipes can also be \"flagged\" to mark them as untested, tested and\n   working, requiring further improvement, outdated, etc.\n\nRepurposing Recursive Recipes\n   As recipes can include other recipes, this can be used for other\n   analysis and planning purposes.\n\n   For example. an \"average breakfast\" meta-recipe which just contains one\n   of all the other breakfast recipes; divided by the number of serves\n   this provides an average breakfast which can be used for planning.\n   This can be combined with other \"typical meal\" meta-recipes to make\n   an \"average day\" overview which can be used as a meal plan.\n\n   This can also be used as a sort of \"variables\" in other recipes,\n   e.g. if you sometimes use normal flour or gluten free flour, a \"flour\"\n   recipe can be created which can be used to toggle between them with\n   one change which effectively toggles the ingredient in multiple\n   recipes at once.\n\nPANTS doesn't make assumptions or guesses\n   It is preferable to show no data instead of wrong data. If an ingredient has\n   something missing (e.g. no fibre listed, no prices), any\n   derived statistics will also be missing (e.g. no fibre-per-kj, or no\n   protein-per-$ if there is no price). This also means that recipes\n   which use that ingredient will not show a value for the sum of fibre\n   in that recipe until all ingredients have that data entered in.\n\nPANTS doesn't assume everyone sleeps at midnight\n   Diary shows breakdown of nutrients by both calendar day and 24-hour\n   periods, so it can be used by shift workers or those with irregular\n   sleep cycles.\n\nRecipes update; Diary doesn't change\n   Diary entries are \"crystallized\" (future changes to a recipe do not\n   affect past entries). On the other hand, changes to an\n   ingredient/recipe immediately show up in any recipes which use them.\n\nOnce-off Diary entries\n   Diary entries do not have to be linked to a specific\n   ingredient/recipe, one off diary entries can be created with manual\n   nutritional data e.g. when going out for the night and you can only\n   guess how many calories are in dinner.\n\nPer-user and global data\n   Ingredients and Recipes added by the admin are visible to all users\n   (but not editable by them); Normal users can also enter in their\n   own Recipes and Ingredients, which only they have access to\n   (sharing may be added in a later version).\n\nProgress/Percentage bars\n   Once your default target is set, it will be used to compare against\n   ingredients/recipes you view so you can see how much % of your\n   daily intake that recipe/ingredient will satisfy. On most pages,\n   Green/Yellow/Red bars indicate how much of the daily target's\n   minimum/maximum are accounted for; Purple progress bars are used\n   to show percentage out of the current total, or amount compared to the\n   highest value in a list of recipes/ingredients.\n\nMicronutrients\n   All Australian standard nutritional data is stored (e.g. sodium and\n   saturated fat) but not everything is shown in all views by default.\n   There was support for micronutrients such as individual amino acids\n   which was removed as part of a DB schema change but this is planned to\n   be readded in a more stable way (see roadmap for details).\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nIt is highly recommended that PANTS is installed in a virtualenv, and\ncomes with a requirements.txt for pip::\n\n   virtualenv -p python3 pants\n   cd pants\n   . bin/activate\n   git clone https://github.com/dylanleigh/PriceAndNutritionTrackingSystem.git\n   cd PriceAndNutritionTrackingSystem\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThese will be installed automatically via pip:\n\n- Django 2+\n- Django-extensions 1.8+\n- Django REST Framework\n- Django-filter\n\nSetup 1: Secret Key\n-------------------\n\nThe environment variable \"PANTS_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY\" needs to be set for\nPANTS/Django to start.\n\nThe exact place to set this will depend on the OS and environment you\nare using. For hosted infrastructure such as AWS or Heroku this can be\nset in the instance settings; for local installs you can set it as\npart of the virtualenv activation script or as a variable on the\naccount of the user who will be running it::\n\n   echo export PANTS_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='968af690a7bcca77c9261e395885af77bc661d1c' >> ~/.profile\n\nYou can generate an appropriate secret key from the SHA1 of any\nrandomly chosen phrase or file::\n\n   $ echo blahblahblah | sha1sum\n   968af690a7bcca77c9261e395885af77bc661d1c  -\n   $ export PANTS_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='968af690a7bcca77c9261e395885af77bc661d1c'\n\nWarning\n   The Django Secret Key is used to generate session tokens and other\n   cryptographically important things. Keeping it in an environment\n   variable makes it easier to have seperate, secure secrets on different\n   installations. If someone knows the secret key it may be possible to\n   login as admin users and mess with things, so keep it secret.\n\nSetup 2: Migrations and Admin User\n----------------------------------\n\nFinally you will need to run initial migrations and create an admin\nuser who can log in and create the initial ingredients, recipes etc::\n\n   cd pants\n   ./manage.py migrate\n   ./manage.py createsuperuser\n\nStarting the Server\n-------------------\n\nTo run the server locally and access it via a browser::\n\n   ./manage.py runserver\n\nSample Ingredient Data\n----------------------\n\nThe author's ingredient data (about 200 ingredients as of 2019) can be\nimported from a fixture with this command::\n\n   ./manage.py loaddata fixtures/pants-ingredient-fixture.json\n\nThis command should only be run on an empty/new database, to avoid\noverwriting any entries you have already created \n\nStarting data entry\n-------------------\n\nYou will need to log in as an admin user (at\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/adminbackend/ ) to start creating initial\ningredients, and then recipes which use those ingredients (and recipes\nwhich use those recipes...)\n\nThe about page will show some basic DB stats, including the count of\ningredients which are missing nutritional data and other potential\nissues.\n\nNo ingredients/recipes need to be created to start using the diary\n(although every entry will have to have all its data added manually if\nthere are no recipes or ingredients to use).\n\nAdding Non-Super Users\n----------------------\n\nTODO this needs to be documented for API consumers.\n\nAPI\n===\n\nThis is a work in progress as of 2020-04-13. Documentation will go\nhere when it's implemented for all major models. It is located at\n/api/1/ (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/1/ on a local server).\n\nHistory\n=======\n\nPANTS grew out of a spreadsheet I was using in early 2017 to do\nnutritional analysis of different foods, looking for the best ratios\nof protein and fibre to calories and cost.\n\nI wanted to add recipes which combined different ingredients and this\nbecame so cumbersome I realised it would be easier to do in a DB and\nstarted the project in Django, importing the initial set of\ningredients from the spreadsheet. Soon I also realised since I was\nentering in all my recipes here it would also be easier if I used it\nas my daily calorie counter and added that as well.\n\nSchema Changes\n--------------\n\nFor all changes mentioned here, your database must be migrated by\nrunning the following commands::\n\n   git pull\n   ./manage.py migrate\n\nNo further user input or manual conversion should be required. The\ndetails below are mostly for background.\n\n2020-04-13\n   Recipe and Ingredient can now be linked to an \"owner\" (user) - user\n   created recipes and ingredients through the API will be owned by\n   that user. Only the logged in user can see/edit things they own.\n\n   \"Global\" recipes/ingredients with no owner are visible to everyone,\n   and only editable by admin (i.e. no change from previous versions)\n\n2020-04-02\n   Each Recipe and Ingredient may now have an \"Introduction\" and\n   \"Notes\" - these are freeform text fields that are simply displayed\n   at the start/end of the detail page for the recipe or ingredient.\n\n2020-03-20 (v0.93)\n   Following on from yesterday's changes, Price has now been fully\n   detached from Product. This update also changes Prices to require an\n   Ingredient set (during the migration, this was optional to allow\n   data to be migrated automatically).\n\n   If there are errors applying this migration it is probably because\n   there are Price objects which don't have an Ingredient. The last\n   version should have converted all the old ones automatically, and\n   converted any new ones created in the admin when they were saved.\n   However, if by some chance you have any corrupt prices not linked to\n   an ingredient, these will have to be deleted for the migration to\n   work.\n\n   The product model still exists, but is now deprecated; it has no\n   current purpose except to associate brand names with ingredients.\n   If you don't care about that, products can be all safely deleted\n   via the admin interface (use the checkbox to \"select all\" and then\n   drop-down action box to \"delete selected\"). They should not be\n   any performance effects from leaving them there, as no calculations\n   use products anymore.\n\n2020-03-19 (v0.92)\n   Prices are changing from being attached to a Product to directly\n   being attached to Ingredient, to simplify both the user interface\n   and the code.\n\n   As of this version, Price is attached to both Product and\n   Ingredient. Ingredient will be set automatically from the Product.\n\n   Future versions will make Price settable via the Ingredient section\n   of the admin interface rather than Product.\n\n2020-03-11\n   Recipe Flags added. These differ from Tags in two ways - each\n   recipe can have only one flag, but flags are much more visible\n   (being shown in lists etc).\n\n   The intended use case is to mark recipes which are OK for general\n   use to differentiate them from recipes which aren't working and\n   need further changes and testing, or outdated recipes no longer\n   recommended. However, they can be used for whatever the admin\n   wants.\n\n   Also, tags for Recipe and Ingredient can now have a brief text\n   description which is shown in list view when that tag is selected.\n\n2019-09-07 (v0.91)\n   Recipe Components now have separate \"servings\" and weight\" to bring\n   them in line with the way all other models work (previously,\n   \"weight\" was interpreted as number of serves if connected to a\n   recipe).\n\n   This fixes various issues, including data entry errors from\n   overloading one field to have two meanings and allows a lot of the\n   code between ingredient/recipe/diary to be simplified.\n\n   Existing recipes will be converted to this new system by\n   recipes/migrations/0018_auto_20190908_0152.py when the migrate\n   command is run.\n\nRemoved Features\n----------------\n\nProducts (partially)\n   After the nutrient model was merged into Ingredient, Product lost\n   it's ability to have separate nutrient data, and it was just a\n   redundant way of linking prices to ingredients, which is now done\n   directly.\n\n   The product model still exists in the admin, but currently has no\n   purpose except to associate brand names with an ingredient.\n   It may be used again in the future for storing further data about a\n   specific branded product.\n\nCollections\n   Never properly implemented; need for this is reduced by heavier\n   use of tags, creative use of recursive recipes (e.g. a \"daily meal\n   plan\" as a \"recipe\"), better frontend comparison tools and CSV\n   export to spreadsheet for doing analysis there.\n\nPlots\n   Recipes/Ingredients now have a CSV export button, use that to\n   create charts externally via a spreadsheet.\n\nAmino Acids\n   The original design could handle detailed micronutrient\n   stats (including individual amino acids, minerals, EFAs, fibre types)\n   but when the nutrients object was merged into ingredient this was\n   dropped. It was rarely used, but may be readded when the\n   nutrient_data class/cache system is reworked to be less kludgy - see TODOs\n\nDeveloper Notes\n===============\n\nAs mentioned earlier the code contains many crufty bits because many\nfeatures were added quickly when immediately required.\n\nIn particular, sets of \"nutrition data\" are often passed around as a\ndict with a few specific sets of keys (specified in settings) and\nthere is an ongoing project to convert this to a class that manages it\nin a sane way, handling all comparisons, additions and per-weight\ncalculations sensibly. A lot of future work is on hold pending this\ntech debt cleanup to be completed.\n\nSee the todo list below for more details.\n\nBits Useful for Other Projects\n------------------------------\n\n- Recipe/Ingredient have a very simple but effective CSV export view.\n- There are convenient templatetags to do division, combined min/max percentage display and generate a little CSS bar chart (most tabular data uses them, see the screenshots for examples).\n\n\nRoadmap, Todos and Issues\n-------------------------\n\nSee https://github.com/dylanleigh/PriceAndNutritionTrackingSystem/blob/master/TODO.rst\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nDylan Leigh 2017-2019\n\n\n"

The cameras are positioned 90 degrees apart and sweep 90 degrees during video capture so that the dish is captured from all sides.\nVideo files are found in `imagery/side_angles/` and are organized by dish id. To extract all 2D image frames from a video, use ffmpeg as shown below:\n```\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 output_%03d.jpeg\n```\n\nThe models included in the Nutrition5k paper were trained and evaluated on every fifth frame sampled from each video, and we include two scripts to help with this. `scripts/extract_frames.sh` walks through each dish_id directory, extracts each frame from all four videos, and outputs the frames to a newly created `dish_ID/frames/` directory. `scripts/extract_frames_sampled.sh` accepts a command line argument to extract only every nth frame from each video.\n\n```\ncp scripts/extract_frames*.sh imagery/side_angles\ncd imagery/side_angles\nsh extract_frames.sh\nsh extract_frames_sampled.sh 5\n```\n\n#### Overhead RGB-D Images\nThe `imagery/realsense_overhead/` directory contains RGB, raw depth, and colorized depth images organized by dish ID. Raw depth images are encoded as 16-bit integer images with depth units of 10,000 (i.e. 1 meter = 10,000 units). The colorized depth images provide a human-readable visualization of the depth map, with closer objects in blue and further objects in red. All depth values are rounded to a maximum of 0.4m (4,000 depth units), which exceeds the height of our food scanning rig.\n\n#### Ingredient Metadata\nThe ingredient metadata CSV (`metadata/ingredient_metadata.csv`) contains a list of all ingredients covered in the dataset's dishes, their unique IDs, and per-gram nutritional information sourced from the USDA Food and Nutrient Database. Ingredient IDs take the following form: `ingr_[ingredient number padded to 10 digits]`.\n\n#### Dish Metadata\nThe dish metadata CSVs (`metadata/dish_metadata_cafe1.csv` and `metadata/dish_metadata_cafe2.csv`) contain all nutrition metadata at the dish-level, as well as per-ingredient mass and macronutrients. For each dish ID `dish_[10 digit timestamp]`, there is a CSV entry containing the following fields: \n\n<i>dish_id, total_calories, total_mass, total_fat, total_carb, total_protein, num_ingrs, (ingr_1_id, ingr_1_name, ingr_1_grams, ingr_1_calories, ingr_1_fat, ingr_1_carb, ingr_1_protein, ...)</i>\n\nwith the last 8 fields are repeated for every ingredient present in the dish.\n\n#### Train/Test Splits\nWe include dish IDs for the training and testing splits used in our experiments in the `dish_ids/splits/` directory. All incremental scans that compose a unique plate are held within the same split, to avoid overlap between the train and test splits. See Section 3.6 of our paper for more details on incremental scanning.\n\n#### Evaluation Script\nTo help evaluate nutrition prediction methods, we provide `scripts/compute_eval_statistics.py`. This script can be used to calculate absolute and percentage mean average error from a CSV of per-dish nutrition values. This tool can be used to generate regression results that can be directly compared to those reported in our paper. See the header file for usage instructions.\n\n## Dataset Bias Disclaimer\nThe dataset does not cover all food cuisines, as it was only collected in a few select cafeterias in California, USA.

Kcal is a *personal* system that focuses on direct\ncontrol of inputs (as opposed to unwieldy user generated datasets) and a minimal,\neasy to use recipe presentation for preparing meals.\n\n## Demo\n\nA [demo of kcal](http://demo.kcal.cooking) is available on Heroku. Login credentials are:\n\n- Username: `kcal`\n- Password: `kcal`\n\nThe demo instance resets every hour, on the hour.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![kcal mobile screenshot](screenshots/mobile.png)\n![kcal desktop screenshot](screenshots/desktop.png)\n\n## Functionality\n\nKcal's primary functionality includes three main content categories -- journal,\nrecipes, and foods -- and two per-user configurations -- goals and meals. Users\ncan customize meals (up to eight per day) for meal planning, set multiple\ngoals for tracking calories and macros (fat, carbohydrates, protein), enter food\ndata with calories and macros, create recipes based on foods and other recipes,\nand record foods and recipes in a journal tracked against goals.\n\n### Foods\n\nFoods are shared between all users.\n\nFoods are the basis for recipes and calorie and macro calculations throughout the\napp. They can be added directly to journal entries and included in recipes that\nroll-up nutritional data per serving.\n\nFood servings can be recorded using U.S. measure units (teaspoon, tablespoon, cup)\nand use a weight basis of grams. These units and weights are commonly used in the\nUnited States and required by law for most packaged foods. Kcal tries to make data\nentry as easy as possible by organization field order and units to match nutritional\nlabel configurations.\n\nFood data does not (currently) make use of any API or service for retrieving\ninformation about food. While this may change in the future, there are a couple\nof reason this feature has been left out of kcal:\n\n - There is a very large volume of data in most food databases such that organizing,\n   categorizing, and searching for the right food can be daunting.\n\n - Food databases that allow and include input from large groups of users can be\n   inaccurate and counter-productive for users with calorie and/or macro goals.\n   \n - Kcal's self-hostable nature is in part for privacy-conscious users so limiting\n   interactions with third-party services is desirable (though adding APIs as an\n   optional enhancement is not a major concern here).\n\nFoods are taggable and tags can be used to filter and search for foods quickly.\n\n![kcal foods edit and show screenshot](screenshots/foods.png)\n\n### Recipes\n\nRecipes are shared between all users. They (currently) cannot be shared externally,\nbut a feature enhancement to support optional, per-recipe public link creation is\nplanned.\n\nConfigurable recipe metadata includes servings, weight, volume, timing, image,\ndescription, ingredients, and steps.\n\nThe recipe view is meant to be as uncluttered as possible, to support browser\n\"reader mode\", and to still provide nutritional metadata at a glance.\n\nRecipes are taggable and tags can be used to filter and search for recipes quickly.\n\n![kcal foods edit and show screenshot](screenshots/recipes.png)\n\n### Journal entries\n\nJournal entries are private. Each user has and can only see their own entries.\n\nPlanning and tracking calories and macros is the primary focus of journal entries.\nThe journal section aggregates this information by day and by meal.\n\nRecipes and foods can be added to journal entries in various quantities and configurations\n(depending on the associated serving data). Manual entries can also be used to record\ndata for foods and recipes *not* in the kcal's database.\n\nJournal entries are not editable. The calorie and macro information for each entry is\nrecorded with the entry. This allows for recoding and maintaining journal entry\ndata even as foods and recipes are updated.\n\n![kcal journal entries edit and show screenshot](screenshots/journal-entries.png)\n\n### Goals\n\nGoals are private. Each user can create and see only their own goals.\n\nGoals reflect daily calories and macros and are therefore closely related to journal\nentries.\n\nGoals can be configured as \"default\" for specific days of the week but can also\nbe overridden for individual days in the journal section.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of goals a user can create.\n\n![kcal goals edit and show screenshot](screenshots/goals.png)\n\n### Meals\n\nMeals are private. Each user can rename, arrange, and enable or disabled their\nown meals.\n\nMeals are used to aggregate data within a day in the journal section and can be\nused for both meal planning and goal tracking.\n\nThere is a pre-configured maximum of eight meals for each user.\n\n![kcal meals edit and show screenshot](screenshots/meals.png)\n\n## Use cases\n\nKcal's primary focus is tracking nutrition (recipe management is the most important\nsecondary focus), so it should be a useful tool for anyone looking to implement a\nspecific diet. Below are some (very) broad diet types and information about how\nkcal can be helpful. Kcal intentionally **does not** provide any specific dieting\nguidance or recommend any particular diet or type of diet. Individual users are\nexpected to research and make their own plans and goals -- kcal is here to help\nrecord and organize the data.\n\n### Hypocaloric diets\n\nHypocaloric diets use [calorie restriction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction)\nfor weight loss or other dietary management. Kcal users can create low calorie\n(relative to personal regular calorie) intake goals and use the detailed nutritional\ndata of food and recipes and to plan meals and record caloric intake using journal\nentries.\n\n### Hypercaloric diets\n\nHypercaloric diets are used for weight gain and can be especially useful for building\nmuscle in weight training. Kcal users can create calorie goals that exceed expected\ncalorie burn on a day-to-day basis. For the weight training example users can create\na goal for training days and separate, lower goal for rest days. The goals can be\nautomated based on the day of the week and journal entries can be used to ensure\nthat a proper macro balance is maintained. More meals may also be helpful on a\nhypercaloric diet and kcal supports up to eight meals per day.\n\n### Plant based diets (vegetarian, vegan, etc.)\n\nDiets that exclude animal-based products may require special attention to ensure\na proper balance of nutrients (particularly when transitioning). Kcal's goals and\nfood nutritional data can help to make sure that appropriate fat, carbohydrate,\nand protein needs are met.\n\n### Low-X diets\n\nAny diet that focuses on lowering a particular nutrient can be trackable with kcal.\nIn addition to the macronutrients (fat, carbohydrates, and protein) foods support\ncholesterol and sodium data as well. Support for other common nutrients like\nsaturated fats, trans fats, fiber, sugar, etc. may also be available in future\niterations.\n\n## Deployment\n\nDocker is the recommended deployment method. See [kcal-app/kcal-docker](https://github.com/kcal-app/kcal-docker).\n\nGeneral requirements for any deployment are:\n\n - PHP 8.x with Composer 2.x and PHP extensions: `bcmath`, `curl`, `gd`, `intl`,\n   `mbstring`, `xml`, `zip`.\n - Web server/proxy (Apache, nginx, etc.)\n - Database (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)\n\nOptional but useful additions are:\n\n - [Search driver](#search-mag) (Algolia, Elasticsearch, and database supported)\n - Redis\n - [Media Storage](#media-storage) (local or AWS S3 supported)\n\n### Docker\n\nThere is a [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) and automated build process to create builds\nat [kcalapp/kcal](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kcalapp/kcal) on Docker Hub.\nSee the [kcal-app/kcal-docker](https://github.com/kcal-app/kcal-docker) repository\nfor a Docker Compose based template and instructions.\n\n### Heroku\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\n\nThe default username and password for a Heroku deployment is `kcal`/`kcal`.\n\n#### Using Heroku CLI\n\nFor a manual deploy using Heroku CLI, execute the following after initial deployment:\n\n    heroku run php artisan migrate\n    heroku run php artisan user:add\n    heroku config:set APP_KEY=$(php artisan --no-ansi key:generate --show)\n\n#### Media storage\n\nHeroku uses an ephemeral disk. In order to maintain recipe and/or user images between\napp restarts AWS can be used. See [Media Storage - AWS S3](#aws-s3) for additional\nguidance.\n\n#### Search drivers\n\nSee the [Search](#search-mag) section for information about supported drivers. Additional\nenvironment variable configuration is necessary when using any search driver other\nthan the default (\"null\").\n\n#### Redis Add-on\n\nThe [Heroku Redis](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis) add-on can be\nadded to the app and will work without any configuration changes. It is left out\nof the default build only because it takes a very long time to provision.\n\n### Manual\n\nThis deployment process has been tested with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS instance with\n2GB of memory which should be enough to host the app for a few regular users.\nThe memory is primarily needed for Elasticsearch -- See the [Search](#search-mag) \nsection for other options if lower memory support is needed.\n\n1. Add [PHP 8.x repository](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php).\n\n       sudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php\n\n1. Add [Elasticsearch 7.x repository](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html).\n\n       wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -\n       echo \"deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list\n\n1. Update available packages.\n\n       sudo apt-get update\n\n1. Install dependencies.\n\n       sudo apt-get install elasticsearch mysql-server-8.0 nginx-full php8.0 php8.0-bcmath php8.0-cli php8.0-curl php8.0-gd php8.0-intl php8.0-mbstring php8.0-mysql php8.0-redis php8.0-xml php8.0-zip redis php8.0-fpm\n\n1. Start Elasticsearch and configure to run at start up.\n\n       sudo systemctl start elasticsearch\n       sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch\n\n1. Install Composer.\n\n    :rotating_light: This command runs code from a remote location as root.\n    See [Download Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) for alternative install options.\n\n       curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin/ --filename=composer\n\n1. Clone the app repository.\n\n       cd /var/www\n       sudo mkdir kcal\n       sudo chown $USER:`id -gn $USER` kcal\n       cd kcal\n       git clone https://github.com/kcal-app/kcal.git .\n\n1. Configure nginx to serve the app public files.\n\n       sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/kcal.conf\n       <edit config, see example below>\n       sudo service nginx restart\n\n    Example config:\n\n       server {\n           listen 80;\n           server_name kcal.example.com;\n           root /var/www/kcal/public;\n           \n           add_header X-Frame-Options \"SAMEORIGIN\";\n           add_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\";\n           \n           index index.php;\n           \n           charset utf-8;\n           \n           location / {\n              try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;\n           }\n           \n           location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }\n           location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }\n           \n           error_page 404 /index.php;\n           \n           location ~ \\.php$ {\n              fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.0-fpm.sock;\n              fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;\n              include fastcgi_params;\n           }\n           \n           location ~ /\\.(?!well-known).* {\n              deny all;\n           }\n       }\n\n1. Create database user.\n\n       sudo mysql -u root\n       CREATE DATABASE `kcal`;\n       CREATE USER 'kcal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY RANDOM PASSWORD;\n       GRANT ALL ON `kcal`.* TO 'kcal'@'localhost';\n       FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n    :lock: Save the generated password output by the `CREATE USER` statement.\n\n1. Install dependencies and generate an app key to use in the next step.\n\n       composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev\n       php artisan --no-ansi key:generate --show\n\n1. Copy environment config file and adjust as desired.\n\n       cp .env.example .env\n\n    At a minimum:\n     - Set `APP_KEY` to the value generated in the previous step.\n     - Set `APP_URL` to match the host configured in nginx configuration.\n     - Set the `DATABASE_` values to the configured credentials.\n\n1. Run initial app installation/bootstrap commands.\n\n       php artisan migrate\n       php artisan elastic:migrate\n       php artisan config:cache\n       php artisan route:cache\n       php artisan view:cache\n       php artisan user:add --admin\n\n1. Allow web server to access required directories.\n\n       sudo chown -R $USER:www-data {storage,public}\n       sudo chmod g+s {storage,public}\n\n1. Visit the `APP_URL` and log in!\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Media Storage\n\nRecipes and users can have associated media (images) that by default are stored\non a local disk under the path `{app}/public/media`. If a local disk solution is\nnot feasible, an AWS S3 bucket can be used instead.\n\n#### AWS S3\n\nUse the general guidance below to create an AWS S3 bucket and IAM user for media\nstorage in AWS S3.\n\n1. Create a bucket that allows objects to be configured with public access.\n\n1. Create an IAM user with access to the bucket.\n\n    Use this example policy to grant necessary permissions to a specific bucket:\n\n       {\n           \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n           \"Statement\": [\n              {\n                 \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\",\n                 \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                 \"Action\": [\n                     \"s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock\",\n                     \"s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus\",\n                     \"s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock\",\n                     \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\",\n                     \"s3:GetBucketAcl\",\n                     \"s3:GetBucketLocation\"\n                 ],\n                 \"Resource\": \"*\"\n              },\n              {\n                 \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor1\",\n                 \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                 \"Action\": \"s3:ListBucket\",\n                 \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::REPLACE_WITH_S3_BUCKET_NAME\"\n              },\n              {\n                 \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor2\",\n                 \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                 \"Action\": [\"s3:*Object\", \"s3:*ObjectAcl*\"],\n                 \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::REPLACE_WITH_S3_BUCKET_NAME/*\"\n              }\n           ]\n       }\n\n1. Set necessary environment variables (via `.env` or some other mechanism).\n\n       MEDIA_DISK=s3-public\n       AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=REPLACE_WITH_IAM_KEY\n       AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_IAM_SECRET\n       AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=REPLACE_WITH_S3_BUCKET_NAME\n       AWS_BUCKET=REPLACE_WITH_S3_BUCKET_REGION\n\n### Search :mag:\n\nThe \"ingredient\" (food or recipe) search for journal entries and recipe ingredients\nsupports three different backends using the `SCOUT_DRIVER` environment variable.\nIn all cases, always ensure that the `SCOUT_DRIVER` environment variable is only\nset once in kcal's `.env` file.\n\nCurrently, the food and recipe *list* searches do not take advantage of these\nsearch drivers. Support for those searches will be added if the Laravel JSON:API\nadds support for Scout (see: laravel-json-api/laravel#32).\n\n### Algolia (`algolia`)\n\n1. [Create and/or log in](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_in) to an Algolia account.\n\n1. Create an application for kcal.\n\n1. Navigate to the application's \"API Keys\" section.\n\n1. Using the **Application ID** and **Admin API Key** values, update kcal's `.env` file:\n\n       SCOUT_DRIVER=algolia\n       ALGOLIA_APP_ID=<APPLICATION_ID>\n       ALGOLIA_SECRET=<ADMIN_API_KEY>\n\n### ElasticSearch (`elastic`)\n\n1. Determine the ElasticSearch service host and port.\n\n1. Update kcal's `.env` file.\n\n       SCOUT_DRIVER=elastic\n       ELASTIC_HOST=<HOST:PORT>\n       ELASTIC_PORT=<PORT>\n\n   Note: The `ELASTIC_PORT` variable is a convenience option specifically for\n   Docker Compose configurations and is not strictly required.\n   \n1. Run Elastic's migrations.\n\n       php artisan elastic:migrate\n\n### Fallback (`null`)\n\nThe fallback driver is a simple `WHERE ... LIKE` clause search on a couple of key\nfields. Results will not be ordered by relevance, and some fields will not be\nsearched (e.g. the tags fields). Using one of the other options is highly recommended.\n\nSet `SCOUT_DRIVER=null` in kcal's `.env` file to use the fallback driver.\n\n## Development\n\n### Laravel Sail\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)\n- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Clone the repository.\n\n       git clone https://github.com/kcal-app/kcal.git\n       cd kcal\n\n1. Install development dependencies.\n\n       composer install\n\n1. Create a local `.env` file.\n\n       cp .env.local.example .env\n\n1. Generate an app key.\n\n       php artisan key:generate\n\n    Verify that the `APP_KEY` variable has been set in `.env`. If has not, run\n    `php artisan key:generate --show` and copy the key and append it to the\n    `APP_KEY=` line manually.\n\n1. Run it! :sailboat:\n\n       vendor/bin/sail up\n\n1. (On first run) Run migrations.\n\n       vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate\n       vendor/bin/sail artisan elastic:migrate\n\n1. (On first run) Seed the database.\n\n       vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed\n\n    The default username and password is `kcal` / `kcal`.\n\nNavigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) to log in!\n\nCreate a `docker-compose.override.yml` file to override any of the default settings\nprovided for this environment.\n\n### Custom console commands\n\n#### `dev:cache-clear`\n\nExecutes the various cache clearing artisan commands:\n\n- `cache:clear`\n- `config:clear`\n- `route:clear`\n- `view:clear`\n\n#### `dev:reset`\n\nResets and seeds the database by executing the following artisan commands:\n\n- `db:wipe`\n- `migrate`\n- `db:seed`\n\n### Testing\n\nEnsure that Sail is running (primarily to provide ElasticSearch):\n\n    vendor/bin/sail up -d\n\nExecute tests.\n\n    vendor/bin/sail artisan dev:cache-clear\n    vendor/bin/sail artisan test --parallel --recreate-databases\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Nutritional AI\n\nThis is Sakib and Ming's Nutritional AI App that uses Flask/SQLAlchemy. \n\nGraduate Course Report avaiable for viewing [here](https://goo.gl/K7K3ye).\n\n## Overview\n\nThis app incorporates a custom-built machine learning algorithm to suggest what recipes a user should eat. The user may specify the number of suggested recipes, the protein and the specific cuisine. Many scripts (stored in /scripts) were used to scrape food/recipe data from online, clean it in various stages (see /outfiles), and structure it to mold to our database models. Routes were built to expose user services on API endpoints:\n\n* Get suggestions for recipes, based on user history and preferences for foods\n* Select a recipe for consumption, which are learned into your preferences\n* Get a minimal set of stores to buy the ingredients for a particular recipe from\n\nThese services are designed to feed into each other, and are integrated into the Slackbots which communicate with each other to provide a seamless natural language interface for this service flow.\n\nThe design of the bots is loosely coupled, so that it is as easy as possible for anyone to add their own bots which do specific tasks and integrate them into the service flow. The goal is for a master bot to enable bot-service discovery for automatic bot-to-bot communication.\n\n## Setup\n\nAfter going into the directory, these are the steps to get the app up and running locally:\n\n#### Step 1. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies\n\nCreate a new Virtual Environment for the project and source it.  If you don't have Virtual Environment yet, you can find installation [instructions here](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\n\n```\n$ virtualenv venv\n$ source venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nNext we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `pip.req`. If you have issues, try install MySQL python dev libs.\n\n```\n(venv) $ pip install -r pip.req\n```\n\n#### Step 2. Set up the Database\n\nEnter the MySQL shell and create a flask app user and database running locally. If you don't have MySQL yet, you can find installation [instructions here](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html).\n\n```\nmysql> create database nai;\nmysql> create user 'nai'@'localhost' identified by 'nai';\nmysql> grant all privileges on nai.* to 'nai'@'localhost';\n```\n\nNow apply the models defined in the flask app as such:\n\n```\n(venv) $ ./migrate.py db init\n(venv) $ ./migrate.py db migrate\n(venv) $ ./migrate.py db upgrade\n```\n\nFor most table changes, edit nai/models.py, and run the above migrate and upgrade commands again.\n\nIf you happen to change a foreign key, or delete the migrations folder, run the above init, migrate and upgrade commands again.\n\n#### Step 3. Run the Server\n\nNow we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:\n\n```\n(venv) $ ./run.py\n```\n\nOptional: If we want to expose this to a public facing URL, we can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/):\n\n```\n(venv) $ ./ngrok http 5000\n```\n\n## Credit\n\nBuilt by Sakib Jalal & Ming Tai Ha at Rutgers University, kept under the MIT License.\n\nALL STORES SELL ITEMS IN 100g PACKAGES, NO EXCEPTIONS\n"

I beleive the problem is fixed, but if you downloaded previously or have problems please contact someone for support, it's probably not your fault!\n        * Dumps and restores are based on the method described here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-import-export\n      * Install Elixir package dependencies with `mix deps.get`\n      * Create the database in Postgres with `mix ecto.create`, assuming default password etc in config works.\n      * Migrate the database to add migrations since dump was created, via `mix ecto.migrate`\n      * Import the dump to the database via `pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U postgres -d open_pantry_dev openpantry.dump`\n      * Install Node.js dependencies with `yarn install`\n      * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`, or `iex -S mix phx.server` (this gives a server and REPL/console in one window)\n    * ALTERNATIVELY (and with much less detail), if you DON'T WANT TO USE the dump file referenced above/want to generate a dump from scratch, the above dump was generated with a complete USDA food/nutrient database approximately as below, along with non-dump steps above:\n      * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`\n      * Git clone https://github.com/openpantry/nutes locally and run make, modifying if necessary to point at your Postgres DB and the directory path to your local copy in imports.sql (requires golang to build data_cleanup tool)\n      * Add seed data with `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs` but modify to leave out foods/stocks as these are fakes generated by factories, you have real food from USDA\n\nNow you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.\n\n## Learn more\n\n  * Masbia Pantry: http://www.masbia.org/pantry\n  * Volunteer to help develop this app, or other work with Masbia: http://www.masbia.org/volunteer_signup\n"

This project includes scripts to generate appropriate schema and import them into a SQLite database. I've also hand generated a subset of the nutrients that includes commonly-familiar nutrients vs. the very extensive list provided by the USDA.\n\nYou will need to first download the files and unzip them into the data directory, e.g. for release SR24\n\n  cd data\n  wget http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR24/dnload/sr24.zip\n  unzip sr24.zip\n\nThen just run create_db.sh with the name of the file you want to make:\n\n  ./create_db.sh usda.sql3\n\nFor convenience I've included the data files for SR24 in the data directory. I've also included the resulting db for convenience if you just want to use it directly.

  "readme_contents": "The internet is full of recipes. A recipe is really only the *directions* and the *ingredients*, but for any given recipe website you always get a lot more information thatn you want (comments, links, advertisements). For instance the page for [Alton Brown's waffle](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/basic-waffle-recipe.html) recipe looks like this:\n\n![Website example](https://rpiai.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/webcontentgrabber-01.png)\n\nHow can you just pull out the directions and ingredients, in a tag-independent way that can be used across any website?\n\n# Recipe extractor\n\n## How it works\n\nFirst it grabs the Markdown-formatted text of the html page using [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text).  It evalutes the number of 'cooking' related words in each line and pulls out the peak.\n\n![Website example](https://i.imgur.com/enu0SNA.jpg?1)\n\nIt does the same for extracting the ingredient list. Then it scans the directions and the ingredient list to determine what the *actual* baking time would be and gives that estimate. Finally, it parses the measurements and foods in the ingredient list and cross-references the USDA SR27 food databse to get accurate estimations of the nutrition content.\n\n# To Do\n\n- ~~Extract recipes.~~\n- ~~Extract ingredients.~~\n- ~~Cross references ingredients and measurements to USDA database.~~\n- ~~Make AJAX interface.~~\n- ~~Better identifying common foods in USDA database~~\n- ~~Simpler conversion between food dimensions/weights~~\n- ~~Add in pricing~~ \n- Save data as JSON\n- Clean up code by splitting into files\n- Better error handling\n- Add nice CSS into web interface.\n- Add in photos of foods\n\n## Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install python-nltk\nsudo pip install pint\n```\n\nThen goto python console\n```python\n>>> import nltk\n>>> nltk.download('brown')\n>>> nltk.download('maxent_treebank_pos_tagger')\n>>> nltk.download('wordnet')\n```\n\nClone the [SR27 database downloader](https://github.com/tscholl2/fudgen) and run the makefile to generate the database. Copy the database into the same folder. Then go into the database and make sqlite3 fts4 virtual table\n\n```sql\ndrop table data;\ndrop table nutrition_date;\ndrop table nutrition_def;\n\ncreate virtual table data using fts4(ndb_no,shrt_desc,long_desc,com_desc);\ninsert into data(ndb_no,shrt_desc,long_desc,com_desc) select ndb_no,shrt_desc,long_desc,com_desc from food_des;\n\ncreate virtual table nutrition_data using fts4(ndb_no,nutr_no,nutr_val);\ninsert into nutrition_data(ndb_no,nutr_no,nutr_val) select ndb_no,nutr_no,nutr_val from nut_data;\n\ncreate virtual table nutrition_def using fts4(nutr_no,units,tagname);\ninsert into nutrition_def(nutr_no,units,tagname) select nutr_no,units,tagname from nutr_def;\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Example Output\n\nVisit the current incantation at http://ips.colab.duke.edu:8081/extractor.html and run which shows the extraction of the following recipe: [http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/baked-macaroni-and-cheese-recipe.html](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/baked-macaroni-and-cheese-recipe.html).\n\n\n--------------------\n\n# Ingredients\n\n  * 1/2 pound elbow macaroni\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/20099.jpg' width=50>2 1/8 cup elbow shaped Macaroni, dry, enriched (226.8 grams) - $3.76\n\n  * 3 tablespoons butter\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/01001.jpg' width=50>3.0 tbsp Butter, salted (42.6 grams) - $1.08\n\n  * 3 tablespoons flour\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/20581.jpg' width=50>1/8 cup Wheat flour, white, all-purpose, enriched, unbleached (23.4 grams) - $0.12\n\n  * 1 tablespoon powdered mustard\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/02046.jpg' width=50>3 1/8 tsp or 1 packet Mustard, prepared, yellow (15.6 grams) - $0.41\n\n  * 3 cups milk\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/01077.jpg' width=50>3/4 quart Milk, whole, 3.25% milkfat, with added vitamin D (732.0 grams) - $0.58\n\n  * 1/2 cup yellow onion, finely diced\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/11282.jpg' width=50>1.0 cup, sliced Onions, raw (118.3 grams) - $3.93\n\n  * 1 bay leaf\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/02004.png' width=50>1.0 tsp, crumbled Spices, bay leaf (0.6 grams) - $0.09\n\n  * 1/2 teaspoon paprika\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/02028.jpg' width=50>1/3 tsp Spices, paprika (1.1 grams) - $0.07\n\n  * 1 large egg\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/01123.jpg' width=50>1.0 small Egg, whole, raw, fresh (38.0 grams) - $0.19\n\n  * 12 ounces sharp cheddar, shredded\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/01270.jpg' width=50>12 1/8 slice 1 oz. slice CHEESE,CHEDDAR,SHARP,SLICED (340.2 grams) - $10.3\n\n  * 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/02047.jpg' width=50>1.0 tsp Salt, table (6.0 grams) - $0.19\n\n  * Fresh black pepper\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/02030.jpg' width=50>1.0 dash Spices, pepper, black (0.1 grams) - $0.0\n\n  * Topping:\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/21226.png' width=50>1.0 serving 5 servings per 22.85 oz package PIZZA,MEAT & VEG TOPPING,REG CRUST,FRZ,CKD (129.0 grams) - $0.0\n\n  * 3 tablespoons butter\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/01001.jpg' width=50>3.0 tbsp Butter, salted (42.6 grams) - $1.08\n\n  * 1 cup panko bread crumbs\n - <img src='http://ips.colab.duke.edu/extract_recipe/get_google_images/images/18069.jpg' width=50>5 1/4 cup, crumbs Bread, white, commercially prepared (includes soft bread crumbs) (236.6 grams) - $2.83\n\n\n# Directions\nIn a large pot of boiling, salted water cook the pasta to al dente.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, in a separate pot, melt the butter.

Thus, this is a **checkpoint lab**, meaning your project must pass the _blink test_ (or get really close) before you can move forward.\n\nIn order to complete this, you should expect to have to look up some things on your own. Often times, the best way to learn new material is to learn \"on the job\" so don't be afraid of referencing documentation on MDN.\n\nYour goal is to leverage the power of CSS selectors. **You can use no more than one ID and one class to complete this project.**\n\nUse your semantic tags, you may not use `<div>` or `<span>` to complete this project.\n\nNow, the usual...\n  1. If this is a *Practice Lab*, fork this repo and clone down the forked repo. **OR**\n      * If this is a *Lab Assignment*, just clone this repo without forking it.\n  2.

Supply Arial as a back up.\n\nUse description lists for nutrient names and quantities:\n  ```html\n  <dl>\n    <dt>Total Carbohydrates</dt>\n    <dd>37g</dd>\n  </dl>\n  ```\n* It might be a good idea to use a table to represent the recommended daily values at the very bottom of the label.\n* Use a 28px font as the document's root font; use `rem` units to define other fonts.\n* Above all, remember: There is no _one way_ to complete this project.

  "readme_contents": "# SDK-Privacy-Report\nThis repository is a community maintained & sourced documentation of privacy details of popular SDKs. Details include data collected/shared, purposes, tracking details which app developers can use to fill the privacy forms for Apple Privacy Nutrition & Google Safety Section.\n\n## Overview\nAs a part of iOS 14 update, Apple made it mandatory for app developers to disclose privacy details of their apps, termed as Apple Privacy Nutritional Labels. Google also launched a similar app privacy disclosure requirement termed as Google Safety Section. Both of these initiatives benefit consumers to easily see the privacy overview of an app before using it. While app developers know what data they collect, for third party SDKs it requires them to read multiple documentation, ask questions and spend a lot of time to know what to fill. This project is an attempt to save that time by creating a centralized documentation of privacy detail of all SDKs. We are starting with 24 SDKs with a goal to keep increasing the list and encourage the community to contribute to it. \n\n## Repository Structure\nWe have a CSV file and a Readme file for SDK privacy details of Apple & Google. For Apple, there is more documentation and we have relied on official documentation to create this list. For Google, we have used the documentation released for apple privacy labels to create this and will be updating as more google specific documentation is released by companies. We have added a value of 'draft' where we are not sure based on official documentation and would be getting in touch with SDK owners and rely on community support to help us.\n\n**SDK Privacy Report for Apple:**\n| SDK  | Data Types Collected | Linked to User Identity  | Used for Tracking | Purposes | Source |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| Name of the SDK  | Data types as defined by Apple  | Yes/No based on linking  | Yes/No based on tracking  | Purposes as defined by Apple  | Source of this information  |\n| Firebase Analytics  | User ID  | Yes  | No | Analytics |   |\n\n**SDK Privacy Report for Android**\n\nGoogle Data Safety Section will become mandatory in Feb'22. SDKs have not released official documentation yet and we have used their documentation for Apple Privacy Nutrition to create this. Few things to note:\n1. Required/Optional Data: Depends on Opt-in(Consent) or Opt-Out if implemented. Most of the Ad SDKs have that implemented but for certain regions like EU, California, China. If you are in India and not using this, please fill Required.\n2. We will be in touch with the SDK owners to get more details and update source as we get more information.\n\n\n| SDK  | Data Types Collected | Shared  | Processed ephemerally? | Required or Optional? | Purposes |Source |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| Name of the SDK  | Data types as defined by Google  | Yes/No based on sharing  | | | Purposes as defined by Apple | Source of this information|\n| Google Admob  | Approximate Location  | Yes  | No | Required |  \"Advertising or marketing, Analytics, Fraud prevention, security and compliance | |\n\n## \ud83d\udcc4 Resources\n1.

If there is a SDK missing and you want us to add information, start an issue. Also, if you have any questions or want to report incorrect information, please create an issue.\n2. To add information of SDK or edit it, edit the CSV file and submit a pull request.\n\n## \ud83d\udea7 SDKs WIP\nSo far the project has details of 24 SDKs. We are working to add details for the following SDKs:\n1. Pubmatic\n2. Facebook SDK - Share, Places\n3. Google Tag Manager\n4. Inmobi\n5. Vungle\n6. Twilio\n7. Zendesk\n8. Amplitude\n9.

  "readme_contents": "# FoodInfo\n\nFoodInfo is a ruby gem that retrieves food nutrition information from various online data sources.\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\nFoodInfo is available as a gem, so installation is as simple as:\n\n    gem install food_info\n\n\n\n## Supported Data Sources\n\nThere's currently only one adapter implemented, which pulls data from [FatSecret's REST API](http://platform.fatsecret.com/api/Default.aspx?screen=rapih).  The code's modular and adding additional data sources should be fairly straightforward, but since DailyBurn discontinued their API access I don't know of any other solid sources (if you do, though, please let me know and/or add an adapter!).\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Housekeeping\n\nTo use the FatSecret API (currently your only option), you'll first need to [sign up for a free developer account](http://platform.fatsecret.com/api/Default.aspx?screen=r) and retrieve the \"REST API Consumer Key\" and \"REST API Consumer Secret\" from your \"My Account\" tab.\n\nOnce that's done, the first step is to tell FoodInfo which adapter you want to use and what authorization to send.\n\n    FoodInfo.establish_connection(:fat_secret, :key => 'YOUR-KEY', :secret => 'YOUR-KEY')\n\n\n### Caching\n\nTo cache results, FoodInfo supports passing in an instance of a memcache-API-compatible (i.e. responds to <code>get</code> and <code>set</code>) caching object.  I recommend using the [Dalli gem](https://github.com/mperham/dalli).\n\n    require 'dalli'\n    client = Dalli::Client.new('localhost:11211')\n    FoodInfo.establish_connection(:fat_secret, :key => 'YOUR-KEY', :secret => 'YOUR-KEY', :cache => client)\n\nWith that in place repeated <code>search</code> or <code>details</code> requests will pull from the cache, and not the API endpoint.\n\n### Searching\n\nNow we can search for foods.\n\n    cheese = FoodInfo.search('cheese')\n    cheese.total_results    # => 2469\n    cheese.per_page         # => 20\n    cheese.page             # => 1\n    cheese.results          # => ... big array ...\n    cheese.results.first    # => \n    # {\n    #     \"description\" => \"Per 100g - Calories: 403kcal | Fat: 33.14g | Carbs: 1.28g | Protein: 24.90g\",\n    #              \"id\" => \"33689\",\n    #            \"kind\" => \"Generic\",\n    #            \"name\" => \"Cheddar Cheese\",\n    #             \"url\" => \"http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/usda/cheddar-cheese\"\n    # }\n\n(As an aside, I get that pretty, nicely-lined-up console formatting from the remarkably awesome [AwesomePrint Gem](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print)).\n\n#### Pagination\n\nSearch supports pagination via the <tt>page</tt> and <tt>per_page</tt> (max 50) parameters:\n\n    FoodInfo.search('cheese', :page => 2, :per_page => 50)\n\n#### Access to search results\n\nYou can access the results of the search explicitly:\n\n    FoodInfo.search('cheese').results # => ... lots of results ...\n\nBut the SearchResults class includes Enumerable, so you can also just call enumerable methods on it directly:\n\n    FoodInfo.search('cheese').map(&:name) # => array of names of matching foods\n    \n\n### Nutritional Details\n\nOnce you have a specific food item in mind from the search results, you can retrieve a whole lot of additional information.\n\n    cheddar = FoodInfo.search('cheese').first\n    info = FoodInfo.details( cheddar.id ) # => ... a whole lotta data ...\n\nGeneral metadata about the cheese includes id, name, kind, and url, which are identical to what you'd get from the <tt>search</tt> method.  It also has one or more servings, however, and this is where we finally get our nutrition info.\n\n    serving = info.servings.first # =>\n    # {\n    #                     \"calcium\" => 95,\n    #                    \"calories\" => 532.0,\n    #                \"carbohydrate\" => 1.69,\n    #                 \"cholesterol\" => 139.0,\n    #                         \"fat\" => 43.74,\n    #                       \"fiber\" => 0.0,\n    #                          \"id\" => \"29131\",\n    #                        \"iron\" => 5,\n    #     \"measurement_description\" => \"cup, diced\",\n    #       \"metric_serving_amount\" => 132.0,\n    #         \"metric_serving_unit\" => \"g\",\n    #         \"monounsaturated_fat\" => 12.396,\n    #             \"number_of_units\" => 1.0,\n    #         \"polyunsaturated_fat\" => 1.243,\n    #                   \"potassium\" => 129.0,\n    #                     \"protein\" => 32.87,\n    #               \"saturated_fat\" => 27.841,\n    #         \"serving_description\" => \"1 cup diced\",\n    #                      \"sodium\" => 820.0,\n    #                       \"sugar\" => 0.69,\n    #                   \"trans_fat\" => 0.0,\n    #                         \"url\" => \"http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/usda/cheddar-cheese?portionid=29131&portionamount=1.000\",\n    #                   \"vitamin_a\" => 26,\n    #                   \"vitamin_c\" => 0\n    # }\n    \nFor full details on what each of those fields contains, check [the FatSecret documentation](http://platform.fatsecret.com/api/Default.aspx?screen=rapiref&method=food.get#methodResponse).\n\n\n## Legal Note\n\nThe FatSecret TOS requires you not to store, well, [pretty much anything](http://platform.fatsecret.com/api/Default.aspx?screen=rapisd) aside from food or serving IDs for more than 24 hours.  This is annoying, but I figured I'd give you a heads up.\n\n\n## Note on Patches/Pull Requests\n\nContributions are welcome, particularly adding adapters for additional data sources.\n\nAs always, the process is to fork this project on Github, make your changes (preferably in a topic branch, and without changing the gem version), send a pull request, and then receive much appreciation!\n\n## License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2011 [Deviantech, Inc.](http://www.deviantech.com) and released under the MIT license.\n\n"

Upload /wp-nutrition-label to the /wp-content/plugins directory\n\n2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress\n\n3. In any posts or pages where you wish to insert a nutrition label, use the shortcode [nutr-label]. The shortcode accepts the following attributes:\n   servingsize, servings, calories, totalfat, satfat, transfat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, fiber, sugars, protein, id, class, width\n\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\n\n= What units do the attributes use? =\n\n* Grams: totalfat, satfat, transfat, carbohydrates, fiber, sugars, protein\n* Milligrams (mg): cholesterol and sodium\n* Unitless: servings and calories (units are implicit for calories)\n* You should include the unit in the serving size attribute (ie: \"4 oz\")\n\n= What about **Calories from Fat**? =\n\nThe **Calories from Fat** number is computed from the totalfat attribute.\n\n= What about vitamins? =\n\nWorking on it.\n\n= How do I style the nutrition label? =\n\nYou can control the width with the \"width\" attribute. The width attribute uses **ems** as its unit. It is styled to scale but it's likely that the \"Nutrition Label\" text won't scale well as the default font is Helvetica, which isn't fixed-width.\n\nYou can specify the DOM ID of the enclosing **div** by setting the **id** attribute in the shortcode. You can also specify a CSS class by setting the **class** attribute. Then you can provide your own styling to change the label as you see fit.\n\n= How about calculating the nutrition values based on a recipe? =\n\nThis is **really** hard to do. To do it at all reliably requires human intervention to match ingredients names against their entries in a nutrition database. That's a level of difficulty I don't wan to try to tackle with this plugin. You may find the USDA's free online nutrition database useful for looking up nutrition information:\n\nhttp://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/\n\n= How do I contribute translations to other languages? =\n\nYou're welcome to email the .po and .mo files to me at wordpress [at] romkey [dot] com\n\n= Where can I find the development version of the plugin? =\n\nDevelopment work on this plugin is hosted on github at https://github.com/romkey/wp-nutrition-label\n\n== Screenshots ==\n\n1. Example using the shortcode\n\n2. Example output\n\n== Upgrade Notice ==\n\n= 0.3 =\n* Calculate calories from protein, carbohydrates and fat if no calories specified.\n\n= 0.2 =\n* Upgrade only needed to get info into plugin directory pages.\n\n== Changelog ==\n\n= 0.3 =\n* Added code to help support internationalization, improved comments, calculate default total calories if not specified.\n\n= 0.2 =\n* Changed filename from README to readme.txt\n\n= 0.1 =\n* Initial release\n"

The JSON\nformat was chosen for readability and portability reasons.\nNutriana prefers not to modify the nutrient database's official data files, but\nto ensure successful database creation and data import, some changes may be\nnecessary.\nAll modifications are fully disclosed in the */MODIFICATIONS files, and\ntypically involve correcting field size or key constraint definition, using date\nformat instead of string, removing trailing whitespace and/or replacing \"no value\"\nindicators with \"null\".\n\n### If Your Preferred Database is Not Supported\nIt should be easy to add support for other databases by copying one of the Perl\nmodule files (*.pm) and editing it as needed to output the format for your\ndatabase system.  (If you find it's not, let me know by creating an issue.)\nRun the build.sh file to (re)generate the database vendor files.

ETEKCITY Smart Nutrition Scale\n\n:warning: Very much work in progress :warning:\n\nThis is a potential project that tries to reverse engineer the BLE protocol that\nETEKCITY Smart Nutrition Scale (ESN00) uses.\n\n[ETEKCITY Smart Nutrition Scale (ESN00)](https://www.etekcity.com/product/100334) ([DE](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07RJV9QPF) |

  "readme_contents": "# Nutrient Object Management System (noms)\n\nNote: I'm not able to maintain this package right now, so there is a chance that the current API integration is broken/will break given the new FoodData Central API from the USDA.\n\nnoms is a fun and simple Python package that allows you to obtain and work with highly detailed nutrition data for nearly 8,000 entries from the USDA Standard Reference Food Composition Database. No mainstream nutrition tracker apps reflect the level of detail that the USDA has compiled. With noms you can track:\n1. Proximates including macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat), calories, fiber and water content\n2. 11 minerals\n3. 13 vitamins\n4. Specific lipids including EPA and DHA (the most important omega-3s found in fish oil)\n\nThis amounts to 41 nutrients being tracked, but many more are available from the database such as amino acids and other lipids. These can be viewed in all_nutrient_ids.txt, and support for other nutrients will be added in the future as requested. You can add support for these yourself by editing noms/objects/nutrient_ids.json accordingly with entries from all_nutrient_ids.txt.\n\nNote: The Standard Reference Database is used explicitly without the addition of the USDA's Branded Foods database, as only the former allows for highly detailed reports which track 168 different nutrients -- much more information than you would find on an item's nutrition facts! This is especially valuable for nutritionists or people interested in their own health to explore the nutritional content of whole foods. \n\n## Installation\nThe noms package is listed on PyPI and can be installed with pip. Simply do:\n```\npip install noms\n```\nIf you already have it installed and want to upgrade to the most recent version, do:\n```\npip install noms --upgrade\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n1. Get a data.gov API key for free from here: https://api.data.gov/signup/\n2. Initialize a client object with the key you received.\n```python\nimport noms\nclient = noms.Client(\"api key\")\n```\n## Searching the Database\n```python\nsearch_results = client.search_query(\"Raw Broccoli\")\nprint(search_results)\n```\n```\n================================================================================================================\nSearch results for 'Raw Broccoli' on USDA Standard Reference Database\n================================================================================================================\nName                                                                                 Group                    ID\nBroccoli, raw                                                            Vegetables and Vegetable Pro..    11090\nBroccoli raab, raw                                                       Vegetables and Vegetable Pro..    11096\nBroccoli, leaves, raw                                                    Vegetables and Vegetable Pro..    11739\nBroccoli, stalks, raw                                                    Vegetables and Vegetable Pro..    11741\nBroccoli, chinese, raw                                                   Vegetables and Vegetable Pro..    11994\nBroccoli, flower clusters, raw                                           Vegetables and Vegetable Pro..    11740\n================================================================================================================\n```\n## Requesting Food Data From the Database\nIn this example, the ids correlate with Raw Broccoli (11090) and a Cola Beverage (14400). The numbers afterwards represent the mass of that food, in grams. More mass for a given food equals a greater amount of each nutrient in equal proportion (twice the broccoli has twice the vitamins).\n```python\nfood_list = client.get_foods({'11090':100, '14400':100})\n```\n## Initializing a Meal With a List of Foods\nThe foods() method returned a list of two Food objects when given the arguments above, but if you would like to generate a report, analyze or sort a group of foods, they should be merged into a Meal object. This is done by simply constructing a Meal instance with a list of Food objects.\n```python\nm = noms.Meal(food_list)\n```\n\n## Generating and Displaying a Report \nThe report is a dictionary which shows if RDAs (or Adequate Intakes) are being met or exceeded. These values are assigned by default in noms.objects.nutrient_dict, but support will be added to modify these settings in the future.\n```python\nr = noms.report(m)\nfor i in r:\n    print(i)\n```\n```\n{'name': 'Protein', 'rda': 125.0, 'limit': None, 'value': 2.89, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'g'}\n{'name': 'Fat', 'rda': 55.56, 'limit': None, 'value': 0.39, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'g'}\n{'name': 'Carbs', 'rda': 250.0, 'limit': None, 'value': 16.2, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'g'}\n{'name': 'Calories', 'rda': 2000, 'limit': None, 'value': 71.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'kcal'}\n{'name': 'Water', 'rda': 2000, 'limit': None, 'value': 179.61, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'g'}\n{'name': 'Caffeine', 'rda': 0, 'limit': 400, 'value': 8.0, 'state': 'satisfactory', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Theobromine', 'rda': 0, 'limit': 300, 'value': 0.0, 'state': 'satisfactory', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Sugar', 'rda': 0, 'limit': 50.0, 'value': 10.67, 'state': 'satisfactory', 'unit': 'g'}\n{'name': 'Fiber', 'rda': 28.0, 'limit': None, 'value': 2.6, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'g'}\n{'name': 'Calcium', 'rda': 1000, 'limit': 2500, 'value': 49.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Iron', 'rda': 8, 'limit': 45, 'value': 0.84, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Magnesium', 'rda': 300, 'limit': 700, 'value': 21.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Phosphorus', 'rda': 700, 'limit': 4000, 'value': 76.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Potassium', 'rda': 1400, 'limit': 6000, 'value': 318.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Sodium', 'rda': 1000, 'limit': 2300, 'value': 37.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Zinc', 'rda': 12, 'limit': 100, 'value': 0.43, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Copper', 'rda': 0.9, 'limit': 10, 'value': 0.05, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Fluoride', 'rda': 400, 'limit': 10000, 'value': 57.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': '\u00b5g'}\n{'name': 'Manganese', 'rda': 1.8, 'limit': None, 'value': 0.21, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Selenium', 'rda': 70, 'limit': 400, 'value': 2.6, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': '\u00b5g'}\n{'name': 'Vitamin A', 'rda': 900, 'limit': 20000, 'value': 623.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'IU'}\n{'name': 'Vitamin E', 'rda': 15, 'limit': 1000, 'value': 0.78, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'mg'}\n{'name': 'Vitamin D', 'rda': 1000, 'limit': 8000, 'value': 0.0, 'state': 'deficient', 'unit': 'IU'}\n... continued\n```\n## Sorting Foods in a Meal By a Specific Nutrient\nSometimes it is helpful to see which foods contain the most of a given nutrient in a meal. For example, you may want to see which foods contributed the most sugar for a given day. This can be achieved through the following code:\n```python\n# index_from_name returns the index that nutrient information exists in an array of nutrients\nm.sort_by_top(\"Sugar\")\nni = noms.index_from_name(\"Sugar\")\nfor food in m.foods:\n    print(food.nutrients[ni])\n```\n```\n{'nutrient_id': 269, 'name': 'Sugar', 'group': 'Proximates', 'unit': 'g', 'value': 8.97}\n{'nutrient_id': 269, 'name': 'Sugar', 'group': 'Proximates', 'unit': 'g', 'value': 1.7}\n```\nNote that this sorts the foods in the Meal object from greatest to least in terms of how much sugar each food has.\n\n## Generate Food Recommendations in Context of a Meal and Pantry\nBecause it would be computationally expensive to generate a food recommendation in the context of every food in the database, and it may be unrealistic to recommend any food from the database as it may be hard to access, you must define a list of foods that will serve as a pantry object. Here is an example pantry object containing many common whole foods.\n\n```python\n    pantry = {\n    # DAIRY AND EGG\n    \"01001\":100, # butter, salted\n    \"01145\":100, # butter, without salt\n    \"01079\":100, # 2% milk\n    \"01077\":100, # milk, whole\n    \"01086\":100, # skim milk\n    \"01132\":100, # scrambled eggs\n    \"01129\":100, # hard boiled eggs\n    \"01128\":100, # fried egg\n    # MEAT\n    \"15076\":100, # atlantic salmon\n    \"07935\":100, # chicken breast oven-roasted\n    \"13647\":100, # steak\n    \"05192\":100, # turkey\n    # FRUIT\n    \"09037\":100, # avocado\n    \"09316\":100, # strawberries\n    \"09050\":100, # blueberry\n    \"09302\":100, # raspberry\n    \"09500\":100, # red delicious apple\n    \"09040\":100, # banana\n    \"09150\":100, # lemon\n    \"09201\":100, # oranges\n    \"09132\":100, # grapes\n    # PROCESSED\n    \"21250\":100, # hamburger\n    \"21272\":100, # pizza\n    \"19088\":100, # ice cream\n    \"18249\":100, # donut\n    # DRINK\n    \"14400\":100, # coke\n    \"14429\":100, # tap water\n    \"14433\":100, # bottled water\n    \"09206\":100, # orange juice\n    \"14278\":100, # brewed green tea\n    \"14209\":100, # coffee brewed with tap water\n    # (milk is included in dairy group)\n    # GRAIN\n    \"12006\":100, # chia\n    \"12220\":100, # flaxseed\n    \"20137\":100, # quinoa, cooked\n    \"20006\":100, # pearled barley\n    \"20051\":100, # white rice enriched cooked\n    \"20041\":100, # brown rice cooked\n    \"12151\":100, # pistachio\n    \"19047\":100, # pretzel\n    \"12061\":100, # almond\n    # LEGUME\n    \"16057\":100, # chickpeas\n    \"16015\":100, # black beans\n    \"16043\":100, # pinto beans\n    \"16072\":100, # lima beans\n    \"16167\":100, # peanut butter smooth\n    # VEGETABLE\n    \"11124\":100, # raw carrots\n    \"11090\":100, # broccoli\n    \"11457\":100, # spinach, raw\n    \"11357\":100, # baked potato\n    \"11508\":100, # baked sweet potato\n    \"11530\":100, # tomato, red, cooked\n    \"11253\":100, # lettuce\n    \"11233\":100, # kale\n    \"11313\":100, # peas\n    \"11215\":100, # garlic\n    # OTHER\n    \"04053\":100, # olive oil\n    \"19904\":100, # dark chocolate\n    \"11238\":100, # shiitake mushrooms\n    \"19165\":100, # cocoa powder\n    }\n    pantry_food = client.get_foods(pantry)\n```\nNow, with a list of possible foods to recommend, you can call noms.generate_recommendations with the meal we set up earlier, which consists of just broccoli and brown rice.\n```python\nrecommendations = noms.generate_recommendations(m, pantry_food, noms.nutrient_dict, 3)\nfor rec in recommendations:\n    # a recommendation is a list containing the calculated loss after the recommendation\n    # is applied, the index of the pantry for the recommendation, and the amount of that\n    # food / 100g\n    print(str(round(rec[2] * 100, 2)) + \"g\", \"of\", pantry_food[rec[1]].desc[\"name\"])\n```\n```\n50.36g of Seeds, chia seeds, dried\n53.3g of Nuts, almonds\n56.76g of Peanut Butter, smooth (Includes foods for USDA's Food Distribution Program)\n```\nIt is reasonable that the function returned these foods from the pantry as the current daily nutrition is low in protein and Omega-3s, which chia seeds satisfy the most.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Nutrition Facts Label\n\nTags: food, nutrition, nutrition facts, nutrition label, food-cook, recipe plugin, shortcode, global food book\n\nRequires at least: 3.0.1\n\nTested up to: 4.4\n\nStable tag: 1\n\nLicense: GPLv2 or later\n\nLicense URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html\n\nThis plugin provides food bloggers with the ability to add nutrition facts label to their recipe post(s).\n\n## Description\n\nOur motivation for releasing this plugin is based on a forum discussion on the food-cook theme support site.\n\nWe felt that we already had some code that could serve as a basis for producing this plugin, other food bloggers could benefit and possibly improve on.\n\nThis plugin will work best on blogs that use [food-cook](http://themeforest.net/item/food-cook-multipurpose-food-recipe-wp-theme/4915630) theme.\n\nFor food blogs that are not based on the food-cook theme, It is possible to create a [custom post type](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/) called \"recipe\" and an ingredients post_meta entry with key \"RECIPE_META_ingredients\".\n\nWe strongly recommended taking this route or using this plugin under the guidance of a Wordpress developer.\n\nFrom a more technical side, In order to generate a nutrition facts label, you can either generate an image or generate a post_meta key (gfb_recipe_meta_nutrition_facts) that holds JSON data (for each recipe) which is used to generate a nutrition label.\n\nThis plugin also includes a meta box within the recipe post edit page in the admin area, which automatically reads the post_meta entry with key \"RECIPE_META_ingredients\" which mainly contains your ingredients list and uses that to generate the nutrition label.\n\nIn order to automatically display a nutrition label on the every recipe, your Wordpress developer should add this line of code to the best possible place.\n\n```\n  <?php echo do_shortcode( '[embed_nutrition_label]' ) ?>\n```\nIt is also possible to embed this as a short-code from the text editor.\n\nBut based on the food-cook recipe page layout your options may appear limited, hence why it is best that a Wordpress developer helps out here.\n\n```\n  [embed_nutrition_label]\n```\n### How to Video\n[![Nutrition Facts Label Wordpress Plugin Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/oM1LoVSacss/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM1LoVSacss)\n\nThis plugin provides food bloggers with the ability to add a nutrition facts label to their recipe post(s).\n\nThis plugin provides image download option or short-codes as possible ways of sharing nutritive insights. It also provides an update facility that adds a nutrition facts label to already existing recipe posts.\n\nBig thanks to the guys at nutritionix for sharing their [javascript nutrition label](https://github.com/nutritionix/nutrition-label) which we have tweaked and used here.  \n\nWe at [www.globalfoodbook.com](http://www.globalfoodbook.com) are open source and agile proponents. We have open sourced this plugin on [github](https://github.com/globalfoodbook/nutrition-facts-label) and will continue to improve this.\n\nWe appreciate the help we have received from using other plugins and would like to contribute back to this awesome Wordpress community at every chance possible.\n\nAt the moment we are working on improving our algorithms on the backend and would like it if you could join us.\n\nWe would love to hear from you on ways this can be improved, give us a shout via the our website or via email (we [at] globalfoodbook.com).\n\nThanks and Keep pushing\n\n### How to Use this Nutrition Label?\nLogin into your Wordpress account.\nScroll down to the \"Ingredients Section\" and list the Ingredients.\nPress \"Generate Label\" on the Nutrition Facts Label Generator.\nThe nutrition facts are automatically generated for you.\nN:B List the ingredients individually including the quantities.\n\n### How to Include Nutrition Label on Existing Recipes?\nTo include nutrition label on existing food recipes, simply press the \"Go\" button for automatic generation of the nutrition label.\nFor any unsuccessful updates, make sure that the ingredients are placed line by line and in each line they are without commas or fullstops.\nThen press the \"Go\" button to generate label.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n1.

What\u2019s more, people who love cooking usually don\u2019t know how to start when facing too many ingredient pairings. Our Recipe Recommendation System gives users nutritious recipe choices which also satisfy their personal taste. Our target users are busy students and professionals who want to eat healthy. Our goal is to help people with their meal decision and bring up their health consciousness.\n\n## Data\n[Yummly\u2019s API](https://developer.yummly.com/) <br />\n[Open Food Facts Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts) <br />\n[Ingredient and Compound matching](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00196) <br />\nEstimated Energy Requirements Diagram\n\n## Project Architecture\n![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flourishlove/Recipe-Recommendation/master/Architecture.png) <br />\n1. Combine two original dataset into one big recipe-compound matrix. \n2. With recipe-compound data on hand, we use two machine learning algorithms, hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN, to cluster flavor of recipes based on their compound. In final implementation, we use DBSCAN because it discard those isolated recipes and make recipe distribution better.\n3. Use information of user\u2019s body condition to further filter out the recipes to recommend.\n\n\n## Installation\n### 1. Running locally\nIn command prompt, enter code folder and install all necessary python libraries:\n```\n$ cd code\n$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\n$ python application.py\n```\nThen you will see something like\n```\n * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n * Restarting with stat\n * Debugger is active!\n * Debugger pin code: 103-344-409\n```\nWhich means you run our demo successfully.

Personal Nutritionist as the name, the system can act as your personal nutritionist while this system can be used also by nutritionists gaining a lot of information and help in many ways. APIs help the system to get the information in many ways. The user can get details about a number of nutrients, vitamins etc of a fruit or vegetable. The user can add his recipes or get recipes using the API. The System basically helps the user in what to eat and which is good, what will help him and etc, the system will help him filter things easily. The System also allows the user to make a diet plan and remind him of his food timings.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\"https://github.com/tanishqa-lalwani/Personal-Nutritionist/blob/main/Readme_images/Home.PNG\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\">\n\n\n## Features \n\n**1.

Yes, greens are good for you, but how much should we try to eat each day?\n\nDr. Greger\u2019s Daily Dozen details the healthiest foods and how many servings of each we should try to check off every day. He explains his rationale in his book [How Not to Die][book].

Surprising as it may be, spending many hours each day sitting in front of the computer is not an effective way to attain, and maintain, a rock-hard physique.  \n\nOur solution: A nutrition app. \n\nAnd it's your job to build it. \n\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_0e106e84e22155f1d2775e37cd4aa865.gif)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Fork this repo](https://github.com/DeividZavala/PP-React-IronNutrition)\n- Clone this repo into your `~/code/labs`\n\nIn the starter code, we've provided a list of foods in the form of an array of objects.\n\n## Submission\n\nUpon completion, run the following commands\n```\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m \"done\"\n$ git push origin master\n```\nNavigate to your repo and create a pull request from your master branch to the original repository master branch.\n\nIn the pull request name, add your name and last names separated by a dash \"-\"\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Iteration 1 | Display Foods\n\nDisplay a list of the foods. This should include the food's image, its name, and its calorie count. the array of foods is already in the state\n\n**Make sure the image's src property is properly bound** the change is reflected in the DOM.  \n\n### Iteration 2 | Search Foods\n\nCreate an input box to search through the foods by name.\n\nYou're going to need to generate a custom *filter method* to do this.\n\nConsider using the method `filter` of javascript\n\n### Iteration 3 | Add New Foods\n\nCreate a button to add new foods.\n\nWhen a user clicks the button, a form will appear with fields for a name, number of calories, and an image.\n\nWhen the user clicks submit, the food will be added to the list.\n\nThe form should disappear when the user clicks the submit button.  \n\n### Iteration 4 | Today's Foods List\n\nCreate a button next to each item. When a user clicks the button, the corresponding food should be added to a special list of foods which are \"today's foods\".\n\nSomewhere on the page, display a list of today's foods, with a total calorie count.\n\n### Bonus | Quantities\n\nIn addition to the \"Add to today's list\" button, create an input for quantity. Whenever a user enters a number into the input, you should add that many of the item to their list.\n\nThe default quanitity should be 1.\n\n**Super Bonus**\n\nIf the user has added more than one item of the same type to their list, don't display it twice. Instead, display the item's name, and the number of times it has been added.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- `Banana x2`\n- `Salmon x5`\n- `Cake`"

prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)\n\n## Project Overview\n\nA web application that allows users to track the food that they consume and which provides a visualization of eating patterns and nutritional data.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- Ability to sign up with email address or Google account\n- Input info for Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation then determine their daily target caloric intake though activity level\n- A way to update user info weekly to calculate progress on user set weight goals\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n### Front end built using:\n\n#### React\n\n- Makes writing components easy\n- Ease of component reuse\n- Mature dependency, informational and community ecosystem\n\n#### Styling\n\n##### bootstrap\n\n- Allowed quick prototyping\n- Various pre-built components\n- Mature ecosystem\n\n##### reactstrap\n\n- Controllable pre-built react components\n\n##### normalize.css\n\n- Normalize browser styles\n- Increased style consistency across different browsers\n\n##### styled-components\n\n- Allowed us to create components with applied styles and reuse them throughout the app\n- Allowed us to create extensible higher-order components to apply styling\n\n#### State management and Routing\n\n##### redux\n\n- Allowed us to manage complexity of state by keeping data in a single store as data changed throughout the app\n- Mature ecosystem, high adoption rate among react community\n\n##### redux-thunk\n\n- Allows us to write action creators that dispatch asynchronously or conditionally\n\n##### redux-logger\n\n- Makes redux actions traceable and improves debuggability\n\n##### react-router \n\n- Allowed us to conditionally render componets based on the URL the user is visiting\n- Improved UX as it allows the app to behave in the way most websites behave and the way most users expect, i.e. as if there was a folder structure to the application\n\n### Front end deployed to Firebase\n\n- `firebase-tools` used to set up Firebase hosting and auth\n\n#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/nutrition-tracker-be) built using:\n\n##### Express\n\n- point one\n- point two\n- point three\n\n##### PostgreSQL\n\n- point one\n- point two\n- point three\n\n# APIs\n\n## Authentication\n\nWe used Firebase Authentication for user authentication and account creation. We used the Email/Password capability and the Google Account login method as well.\n\nDetails on how Firebase Authentication works can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start).\n\n## API Documentation\n\nOur app's API's are documented in Postman collections [here](https://nutrijournal.postman.co/workspaces/3f11e883-1e39-496e-ac06-063bb81be931/collections).\n\n# Environment Variables\n\nIn order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:\n\n    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY - this is your Google Firebase key, which can be generated in the [Google Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)\n    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard\n    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE - in the Firebase dashboard\n    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID - in the Firebase dashboard\n    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET - in the Firebase dashboard\n    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID - in the Firebase dashboard\n    * REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID - in the Firebase dashboard\n\n# Content Licenses\n\n| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |\n| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| default-user-pic.jpeg    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Back SVG    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Calendar SVG    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Daily Log SVG    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Email SVG    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Facebook SVG   | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Left Carot SVG   | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Progress SVG    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Recipe SVG  | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Right Carot SVG    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Ruler SVG   | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Ruler SVG   | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Scale SVG   | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Scanner SVG    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n| Settings SVG    | Artist   | [Creative Commons](https://google.com) |\n\n\n\n# Testing\n\nTesting was done with [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/en) and [`enzyme`](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/), along with mutation tests using [`stryker`](https://stryker-mutator.io/). Jest and enzyme allowed us to create more dynamic tsts built around our redux framework. Stryker helped us increase the quality and depth of tests by substituting variable and functions with fake data, then checking if tests passed or failed with the substituted data.\n\n# Installation Instructions\n\n`$ yarn install`\n\n## Other Scripts\n\n`$ yarn start` - starts the production server\n\n`$ yarn test` - runs Jest tests in watch mode\n\n# Contributing\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.\n\nPlease note we have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

  "readme_contents": "The administrator manual is intended for the person setting up the system. This needs to include all software and hardware dependencies, download instructions, and any hardware set-up instructions. This is the place to document what systems have been tested, what the expected compatabilities are and any known incompatabilities. If the administrator needs to set up ids and passwords before the system is fully deployed, this needs to be covered in this manual. The administrator manual should include a complete set of easy-to-follow instructions of how to deploy the system in a new environment or how to redeploy the system if it needs to be restarted or refreshed. You again need to be cognizant of the skill level of the administrator. You can assume that it is an adult, but given the intended audience, you must determine the appropriate level of skills that you can assume. This again should be defined in your user descriptions.\n\nGreetings! Thank you for using NutruitionDB, a creation of the COMP 523: Software Engineering course. Authors: Katie Hawthorne (kathryne), Tommy Ferguson (atfergus), Gautam Sanka (gausanka). \n\nIn this document, we will walk you through the process of setting up NutrutionDB on your own server. \n\nSystem Requirements:\n--PHP\n--MySQL\n--Public Server Space\n--Google Drive  \n\nDependencies:\n\n1. Make sure that you have PHP installed on your server. This system has been tested and is known to be compatible with PHP version 5.3.15. The installation of PHP is outside the scope of this administrator manual - please check with your server admin to go through this process. \n\n2. Ensure that you have access to a server running MySQL. Please check with your server administrator to set up a database and provide access to this. \n\n4. You will need a Google Drive account to store photos. \n\n3. As NuTRUtion is a web-based application, you will need a server that is publicly accessible. You may need to work with your server admin to ensure that the file space has the correct file permissions and access rights. \n\nSetting Up NuTRUtion: \n1. Setting up the database\nTo set up the NuTRUtion database, run the nutritiondb.sql script when logged into a machine running MySQL. This should be performed after creating your database and logging into the database. See your server admin if you need information about login and access information for your database. This script will create all of the tables used in the NuTRUtion web application. \n\n2. Setting up the website\nTo set up the website, copy the entire nutrition folder into a publicly-readable folder on your server running PHP. This may be nested however is desirable for your URL structure. You will also need to modify the file dbconnect.php (in the utils folder) to reflect the correct login and credentials for your MySQL server. In this file, modify the lines that define the $host, $username, $password, and $database. You may need to ask your server admin for this information. Replace the values in strings with the correct values that represent your setup. \n\n3. Setting up Google Drive\nTo set up the Google Drive Account, create a Google Account. The current system is using the nutrutionation Google account. Go to http://drive.google.com and create a new folder. The new folder is to be created with the setting that it is publicly accessible on the internet. This setting will then extend to any images that are then subsequently added to the folder. The folder will now have a identifier that can be used to find the image files on the web.\n\nEditing NuTRUtion System Settings:\n1. Changing verification\nAfter your server is up and running, navigate to the Settings page and scroll down to the Admin Settings section. There is an input box that allows you to enter a numerical value. This value represents the number of agreeing submissions that must be captured before a value is considered to be correct from user input data. \n\nUsing NuTRUtion\n1. Adding data\nAfter your server is up and running, navigate to the Settings page and scroll down to the Admin Settings section. To add data to the NuTRUtion database, you should have a .csv (comma separated value) file that contains data collected from nutrition labels that have been OCRed. Remove the first line of column headings if present, and then upload the file. You should see a success statement after the page reloads indicating that the file has been successfully imported to the database. \n\n2. Adding photos\nThe photos should be added to the Google Drive Account at http://www.drive.google.com with the username of nutrutionnation. The folder NNImages contains the existing images and the new images need to be added to this folder. To upload, press on the red upload button on the top left and select the images files to be uploaded. \n\n3. Retrieving data\nAfter your server is up and running, navigate to the Settings page and scroll down to the Admin Settings section. Click on the button that indicates that you can download completed nutrition label information, and you will receive a .csv file of all labels that have been successfully corrected.

Easily access to more than 1.9 million products from all around the world.\nOpen Food Facts is powered by contributors from around the world and is constantly growing thanks to them.\n\n## How to use ?\nYou can find the full documentation here : [Documentation](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-dart/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md).\nYou can find automated code documentation here:  [Documentation](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-dart/).\n\n## General principles\n- You can look for information about products, including many useful computed values. \n- If you can't get the information on a specific product, you can get your user to send photos and data, that will then be processed by Open Food Facts AI and contributors to get the computed result you want to show them.\n- You can also implement the complete flow so that they get immediately the result with some effort on their side.\n\n## Contributing \n\n### If your users do not expect a specific result immediately (eg. Inventory apps)\n- Send photos (front/nutrition/ingredients/packaging): most painless thing for your users\n- The Open Food Facts AI Robotoff will generate some derived data from the photos\n- Overtime, other apps, and the Open Food Facts community will fill the data gaps\n\n### If your users do expect a result immediately (eg Nutrition apps, Scoring apps\u2026):\n- Send nutrition facts + category > get the Nutri-Score\n- Send ingredients > get the NOVA group (about food ultra-processing), additives, allergens, normalized ingredients, vegan, vegetarian\u2026\n- Send category (strict minimum) + labels + origins of ingredients + packaging (photo and text) > get the Eco-Score (about environmental impact)\n\n## Open Data Licence\nThe database in under the OdBL.

  "readme_contents": "# Calorie Counter Chatbot\n\nThis is a Lex based chatbot that will calculate calories made by trips to different fast food restaurants. It is enabled from a [FB Messenger Chatbot](https://www.facebook.com/fastfoodcaloriecounter/) that can be accessed from the Facebook Page, or through the Messenger App on your phone.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n- [How does this use the NLU models from Lex?](#using-nlu-models)\n- [What custom slots are used by the NLU?](#custom-slots)\n- [How can multiple slots be used in a single intent?](#multiple-slots-in-a-single-intent)\n- [What are the lambda functions called by the bot?](#rules-logic-in-lambda)\n- [Where does it get its data from?](#data-lookup-tables)\n- [How do you create large custom slots?](#large-custom-slots)\n- [How does information get shared between intents?](#sharing-session-data-between-intents)\n- [How do you create buttons for the user to click on?](#creating-buttons-in-user-interface)\n- [What does the deployment model look like?](#deployment-pipeline)\n- [Does a bot have a personality?](#add-personality-to-the-bot)\n- [What is the website code for?](#website-in-progress)\n\n## Using NLU Models\nThis bot uses AWS Lex - a service that contains the intelligence to be able to decipher user requests and trigger intents based on data provided in the models. The intents then invoke lambda functions that contain business logic specific to the intent.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fastfoodchatbot/media/LexArchitecture.png)\n\nCurrently there are many different intents that the NLU process sorts into.  Here are the \"core functions\" of the bot.\n- FoodTypeOptions (Sample utterance - What are my food options?)\n- GetCalories (Sample utterance - How many calories in a Big Mac?)\n- GetMexicanFoodCalories (Sample utterance - How many calories in a Chicken Burrito?)\n- GetNuggetsCalories (Sample utterance - How many calories in 20 Chicken Nuggets?)\n- GetPizzaCalories (Sample utterance - How many calories in 2 slices of Pepperoni Pizza at Papa Johns?)\n- GetChineseCalories (Sample utterance - How many calories in a Kung Pao Chicken?)\n- GetChickenCalories (Sample utterance - How many calories in a piece of Original Recipe Chicken?) \n\nThere are also intents that complement the core features.\n- MoreDetails (Sample utterance - More details. Note: this can only be invoked after prior requests are made in the conversation as it's reading data from the session).\n- DailyIntakeAnalysis (Sample utterance - analyze my meal. Similar to more details, this uses session data, so must follow one of the prior requests.\n- WhatPizzaTypes (Sample utterance - What types of pizza are there?)\n- WhichRestaurants (Sample utterance - List of restaurants.)\n- CalculateBMR (Sample utterance - What is my daily recommended calorie intake?)\n- GetCarbs (Sample utterance - How many carbs in this?)\n\nThen there are intents that form the 'personality' of the bot. These were created based on real user usage, and prevent the generic error message from being used to respond.\n- EndConversation (Built-in intent - uses AWS sample utterances like - Stop)\n- Introduction (Sample utterances - Hello, Get Started, Send Message)\n- Thanks (Sample utterances - Thanks, Goodbye, Bye)\n- Complement (Sample utterances - I love you)\n- Critic (Sample utterances - U suck)\n- Shock (Sample utterances - wow, ouch)\n- MyName (Sample utterances - what is your name)\n- HelpRequest (Built-in intent - uses AWS sample utterances like - Help)\n- NewRestaurant (Sample utterance - New restaurant. This clears out the session.)\n\nWithin each of the intents, sample utterances are provided that construct the potential sentances that a user may provide. The value of the slot (i.e. Large Fry) gets passed to the lambda function as a unique attribute.\n\nYou can get the summary information from the AWS CLI by executing the following command.\n\n```sh\naws lex-models get-bot --name FastFoodChecker --version-or-alias PROD\n```\n\n## Custom Slots\nIt is a combination of the sample utterances and slots that determine which intent the NLU models will invoke. These are maintained in Lex, and are used for training the models. \n\nCurrently, here are the custom slots that are used by the intents.\n- FoodOptions (sample values: Big Mac, Smokehouse Brisket Sandwich, etc. This has hundreds of entries, and is generated from the foods.json data object).\n- DrinkOptions (sample values: Water, Iced Tea, Large Diet Lemonade, etc. This has many entries, and is generated from the drinks.json data object).\n- FastFoodRestaurants (sample values: Chick-fil-A, McDonald's, Wendy's)\n- FoodType (sample values: Burger, Salad, Chicken)\n- ExtraItems (sample values: Large Fry, Sugar Cookie, Side Salad)\n- MexicanFoodTypes (sample values: Burrito, Gordita, Soft Taco)\n- Preparation (sample values: Grilled, Fried, Baked)\n- Protein (sample values: Steak, Chicken, Black Bean)\n- PizzaRestaurants (sample values: Dominos, Papa John's, Little Caesars)\n- PizzaSize (sample values: Small, Medium, Large)\n- PizzaType (sample values: Sausage, Pepperoni, Honolulu Hawaiian)\n- ChineseEntree (sample values: Orange Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken)\n- ChineseSide (sample values: Fried Rice, Mixed Vegetables)\n- ChineseAppetizer (sample values: Egg Roll, Spring Roll)\n- FoodAdjustment (sample values: Add Guacomole, No Cheese)\n- DressingOptions (sample values: Italian, Balsamic Vinaigrette)\n- DippingSauce (sample values: Honey Mustard, Sweet and Sour)\n- ChickenPart (sample values: Drumstick, Breast, Wing)\n- ChickenStyle (sample values: Original Recipe, Extra Crispy)\n- ChickenSides (sample values: Mashed Potatoes, Baked Beans)\n\nAn item does not need to be specified in the slot for the NLU to place a value into it. However, if the data is sparse, it may degrade how the NLU interprets the user requests.\n\n## Multiple Slots in a Single Intent\n\nUsability of a chatbot requires natural interaction to occur with a user. One key concept is around how to incorporate multiple slots into a single intent.\nFor example, a user could ask \"How many calories in a Big Mac, Fries, and a Coke?\" That is three different items that each need to be parsed out.\nWithin this chatbot, the main processing has many different slots that map into intents. For example, here are the slots that map into the GetCalories intent.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fastfoodchatbot/media/slotsExample.png)\n\nThere are a couple of items to note in this.\n\n1) In the example request above, the NLU models would parse the data from the utterance into three different slots (Food, Extra, and Drink).\n\n2) The slot order doesn't matter to the parsing, but it does drive what would be the next response (slot 1 - Which Restaurant are you at?)\n\n3) There are two slots that aren't required in this intent - Ketchup and PacketsKetchup. This optional information is asked for if fries is asked for as a side item. This is driven by the code in the Lambda function that is invoked in the Validation code hook.\n\n## Rules logic in lambda\nAll of the logic in formulating responses to different intents is processed in a series of lambda functions. Which lambda function to invoke is managed within Lex, and set at the intent level. This enables modularity to be built within the application, keeping the functions lightweight.\n\nThere are two different spots within Lex that can invoke a lambda function. The first is through basic validation, and the attribute name that identifies it is called invocationSource. \nThere are two potential values for this - DialogCodeHook and FulfillmentCodeHook. Here is where these Lambda functions are specified in the Lex Bot.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fastfoodchatbot/media/lambdaHooks.png)\n\nThe first dropdown is the Validation, and calls the lambda function every time the bot is called. The attribute that it passes is called DialogCodeHook.\nThe second dropdown is the Fulfillment, and only called once the mandatory slots have been completed, and the validation from the initial call is complete.\nThis allows for the functions to be different, enabling better scalability in building the bot.\n\nHere is an overview of each function currently written.\n\n1) lambda.js - the main function that handles the basic validation for queries, sourced only in DialogCodeHook mode.\n\n2) calculate.js - calculating the response for the actual calories in a meal is handled by this funciton, and is sourced by a FulfillmentCodeHook.\n\n3) pizza.js - handles intents around calculating calories in a pizza, including the intent - WhatPizzaTypes.\n\n4) misc.js - handles simple intents like help, the introduction, and more details around a meal.\n\n5) chinese.js - handles intents around chinese food, and coupling the different slots together to form a meal.\n\n## Data lookup tables\nThe core functionality of this bot is to be able to answer queries of how many calories are in different meals. While the slots that Lex uses are helpful in training the NLU models, they don't have the ability to serve as lookup files. \nThat's where the json objects come in that are stored in the [/src/data/](https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/caloriecounter/tree/master/src/data) folder.\n\nHere is a sample of the format.\n```sh\n[\n    {\n        \"restaurant\":\"Chipotle\",\n        \"foodItems\":[\n            {\"foodName\":\"Chicken Burrito\", \"foodType\":\"Burrito\", \"protein\":\"chicken\", \"calories\":975},\n            {\"foodName\":\"Steak Burrito\", \"foodType\":\"Burrito\", \"protein\":\"steak\", \"calories\":945},\n            {\"foodName\":\"Carnitas Burrito\", \"foodType\":\"Burrito\", \"protein\":\"carnitas\", \"calories\":1005},\n```\n\nThe lambda functions refer to these objects to respond to different queries, and to calculate calorie consumption for the user.\n\nEach food item may be duplicated for different spellings and phrases used to retrieve. For example.\n\n```sh\n\t    {\"foodName\":\"Fries\", \"calories\":340},\n            {\"foodName\":\"Fry\", \"calories\":340},\n            {\"foodName\":\"Frys\", \"calories\":340},\n\t    {\"foodName\":\"French Fries\", \"calories\":340},\n            {\"foodName\":\"French Fry\", \"calories\":340},\n\t    {\"foodName\":\"Medium Fries\", \"calories\":340},\n            {\"foodName\":\"Medium Fry\", \"calories\":340},\n```\n\nThere are also lookup tables around sauces, dressings, and individual item adjustments. For example.\n\n```sh\n\n[\n    {\n        \"dressingName\":\"Ranch\",\n        \"calories\":200,\n        \"carbs\":11,\n        \"restaurantNames\":[\"McDonalds\"]\n    },\n    {\n        \"dressingName\":\"French\",\n        \"calories\":300,\n        \"carbs\":22,\n        \"restaurantNames\":[\"McDonalds\"]\n    },\n\n```\n\nGiven that the NLU models do not correct spelling provided by the user, it's up to the Lambda functions to handle this part of the logic.\n\n## Large Custom Slots\n\nManaging large custom slots can be difficult, particularly if the data is dynamic. The main food lookup has several hundred unique values in it, and growing based on user usage.\nThe process for creating this slot has been automated, and the data for the custom slot is taken from the [foods.json](https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/caloriecounter/blob/master/src/data/foods.json) data object.\nThis is done through the AWS CLI that can load these directly from the command line. All of the files are contained in the [slots}(https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/caloriecounter/tree/master/src/slots) directory for reference. \nHere are the steps used to create.\n\n1) The foods.json data object is passed to a lambda function called convertFoodsObjForSlot.\n2) The function sorts through the data, eliminates duplicates, then the data is formatted into a simple array with just the entree names.\n3) The array is returned and then passed into the AWS CLI using the [put-slot-type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lex-models/put-slot-type.html) command.\n4) The model is then manually rebuilt via the console and deployed just like any other training activity.\n\nThe syntax looks like this.\n\n```sh\n# foods.json is the data object that will be passed to the lambda function\nrequest=$(<foods.json)\n\n# invoke the lambda function from the command line and write the output to output.json\naws lambda invoke --function-name convertFoodsObjForSlot --payload \"$request\" output.json\n\ndata=$(<output.json)\n\n# invoke lex to create a new version of the FoodEntreeNames custom slot using the data from output.json\naws lex-models put-slot-type --name FoodEntreeNames --checksum <enter latest checksum here> --enumeration-values \"$data\" >> sysout.txt\n\n```\n\nAlso, the checksum value is from the prior deployment of the custom slot. You can find the current checksum for a slot by the get-slot-type command.\n\n```sh\n\n# find the latest information about a custom slot\naws lex-models get-slot-type --name FoodOptions --slot-type-version '$LATEST'\n\n```\n\n## Sharing Session Data between Intents\n\nThe key to effective long-running conversations between a user and a bot is around managing context of the conversation.\nFor example, a dialog could go on for several minutes, and invoke many intents.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fastfoodchatbot/media/LongChat.png)\n\nPart of facilitating this is designing a flow of the conversation. Error messages should not be too abrupt, and should lead the user to an alternative query.\nThe intents should also pass data between one another. This can be accomplished by saving the session data when completing an intent.\nThis allows the next intent to retrieve the information and not require the user to repeat it with each request.\n\nIn the example above, the conversation begins with the user indicating which restaurant they are eating at. This gets persisted in the session by the FoodTypeOptions intent.\nThe dialog shifts to details of the meal, but the restaraunt name gets saved. Also, the initial response on the calorie count is brief, but offers a more detailed explainatin if the user says 'more details'.\nOnce again the data gets stored in the session data, and is passed back as part of the Lex framework. Here is example of one of the objects.\n\n```sh\n{\n    \"messageVersion\": \"1.0\",\n    \"invocationSource\": \"FulfillmentCodeHook\",\n    \"userId\": \"1712299768809980\",\n    \"sessionAttributes\": {\n        \"restaurantName\": \"Burger King\",\n        \"foodName\": \"Whopper\",\n        \"foodCalories\": \"660\",\n        \"extraName\": \"Onion Rings\",\n        \"extraCalories\": \"410\",\n        \"drinkCalories\": \"310\",\n        \"drinkName\": \"32 oz. Large Coke\",\n        \"totalCalories\": \"1380\"\n    },\n    \"bot\": {\n        \"name\": \"FastFoodChecker\",\n        \"alias\": \"PROD\",\n        \"version\": \"42\"\n    },\n    \"outputDialogMode\": \"Text\",\n    \"currentIntent\": {\n        \"name\": \"DailyIntakeAnalysis\",\n        \"slots\": {},\n        \"slotDetails\": {},\n        \"confirmationStatus\": \"None\"\n    },\n    \"inputTranscript\": \"Analyze my meal\"\n}\n```\n\nThe lambda functions in this bot are completely stateless, so any data from prior invocations must come through the request object.\n\n## Creating buttons in user interface\nOne of the features in the major chatbot user interfaces (Messenger, Slack, etc.) is buttons. These reduce the effort by the user by providing a series of options like so.\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fastfoodchatbot/media/FBMessengerButtons.JPG)\n\nEach messaging platform has their own implementation of this pattern, and [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/template/button) is what Messenger uses.\nLex handles the translation to get the buttons into the correct format, and within Lex, the [responseCard](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/lambda-input-response-format.html#lambda-response-dialogAction) attribute needs to be provided with the specifics on the button detail.\n\n## Deployment pipeline\nModifying Lex is done completely through the console. The lambda functions that serve the business logic are hosted in AWS lambda, and are deployed from an EC2 host.\n\nThe full deployment script is [/src/build.sh](https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/caloriecounter/blob/master/src/build.sh) but a quick overview can be found in the following instructions.\n\n```sh\n# this creates the build package as a zip file containing the code and relevant data objects\nzip -r foodbot.zip lambda.js data/restaurants.json data/foods.json data/drinks.json\n\n# this CLI command copies the build package to an s3 bucket for staging\naws s3 cp foodbot.zip s3://fastfoodchatbot/binaries/\n\n# this CLI command takes the package from the s3 bucket, and overlays the lambda function 'myCalorieCounterGreen'\naws lambda update-function-code --function-name myCalorieCounterGreen --s3-bucket fastfoodchatbot --s3-key binaries/foodbot.zip\n\n# this CLI command invokes the lambda function with the data object  read into request, and writes out a response to the testOutput data object.\naws lambda invoke --function-name myCalorieCalculatorGreen --payload \"$request\" testOutput.json\n```\n\n1) Create a zip file on the host that acts as the build server. It's from the build server where both the source code and data files are manipulated. The datafiles are then read locally, and whenever they change, a new deployment is created.\n2) Upload the zip file to an s3 bucket using the proper AWS CLI commands.\n3) Update the existing lambda function with the new package, and using the AWS CLI command, provide the location of the zip file that contains the build package.\n4) Execute a test of the lambda function directly with valid sample data. The response object is returned and written to the console as well as a local file.\n\nThis process is repeated for each of the lambda functions that are called by Lex. This includes having at least one test condition for each lambda function to ensure that the deployment was done correctly. \n\n## Add Personality to the Bot\n\nOne of the topics in bot design is around having a personality. Something to consider when designing the intents is what are all of the possible questions that a user may ask.\nThis should include off-topic questions, such as 'what is your name' or emotional responses like 'oh-no' or 'you suck'.\nThese are easy to code - usually just a simple request-response with no slots involved, and does tend to make the dialogs more natural.\n\nFor an example, here is a brief response coded in the [misc.js](https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/caloriecounter/blob/master/src/misc.js) function that responds to if someone asks what the bots name is.\nIn the models, an utterance of 'what is your name' resolves to this intent.\n\n```sh\n\nif (intentName === 'MyName') {\n    console.log(\"user requested bot name\");\n    return getBotName(intentRequest, callback);\n}\n...\nfunction getBotName(intentRequest, callback) {\n    const sessionAttributes = intentRequest.sessionAttributes || {};\n\n    var botResponse = \"My name is Chuck. I'm a chatbot that helps people sort out \" +\n\t\"fast food options. Talking about food all day makes me hungry!!!\";\n\n    callback(close(sessionAttributes, 'Fulfilled',\n        { contentType: 'PlainText', content: botResponse }));\n}\n\n```\n\n## Website in progress\nAs part of the initial effort, I was attempting to get this chatbot published to the slack store. As part of that, I needed to build a website for public support of the app. It's a work in progress, and called caloriecountbot.com. It's hosted by s3, and the source is located in the /website folder.\n\n"

These terms are intended primarily to be associated with datasets that quantify concentration of chemical nutritional components derived from samples taken from any stage in the production of food raw materials (including from crops, livestock, fisheries) and through processing and supply chains. Additional knowledge associated with these dietary sources may be represented by terms that describe functional, physical and other attributes. \n\nWhilst recognising that dietary nutrients within food substrates may be present as complex and dynamic physical and chemical structures or mixtures, CDNO focuses on components typically quantified in an analytical chemistry laboratory. The primary CDNO class \u2018dietary nutritional component\u2019 contains hierarchical sets of terms organised to reflect commonly used classifications of chemical food composition. This class does not represent an exhaustive classification of chemical components, but focuses on structuring terms according to widely accepted categories. This class is independent of, but may be used in conjunction with, classes that describe \u2018analytical methods\u2019 for quantification, \u2018physical properties\u2019 or \u2018dietary function\u2019. Quantification data may be used and reported in research literature, to inform food composition tables and labelling, or for supply chain quality assurance and control. \n\nMore specifically, terms within the \u2018nutritional component concentration\u2019 class may be used to represent quantification of components described in the \u2018dietary nutritional component\u2019 class. Concentration data are intended to be described in conjunction with post-composed metadata concepts, such as represented by FoodOn \u2018Food product by organism\u2019, which derives from some food or anatomical entity and a NCBI organismal classification ontology (NCBITaxon) entity. In addition, one or more CDNO analytical method term may be used to describe the process used to acquire concentration data, where these terms may be inherited from the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), the Chemical Methods ontology (CHMO) or the Physico-chemical Methods and Properties ontology (FIX). In combination these formalise the language used to describe sample source and status in the crop production/food supply chain.  \n\nAdditional knowledge relating to interactions of food components with human physiological function is embodied within the CNDO dietary function class, where a nutritional component may be associated with one or more functional categories. \n\nThe common vocabulary and relationships defined within CDNO should facilitate description, communication and exchange of material entity-derived nutritional composition datasets typically generated by analytical laboratories.  The organisation of the vocabulary is structured to reflect common categories variously used by those involved in crop, livestock or other organismal production, associated R&D and breeding, as well as the food processing and supply sector, and nutritionists, inlcuding compilers and users of food composition databases. The CDNO therefore supports characterisation of genetic diversity and management of biodiversity collections, as well as sharing of knowledge relating to dietary composition between a wider set of researchers, breeders, farmers, processors and other stakeholders. Further development of the functional class should also assist in understanding how interactions between organismal genetic and environmental variation contribute to human diet and health in the farm to fork continuum.\n\nA more descriptive guide for the Crop and now Compositional Dietary Nutrition Ontology (CDNO) was published in Crop Science in an article by\u00a0Andres-Hernandez et al. 2020 [doi:10.1002/csc2.20092](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/csc2.20092).\n\nMore information can be found at http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cdno\n\n## Versions\n\n### Stable release versions\n\nThe latest version of the ontology can always be found at:\n\nhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cdno.owl\n\n(note this will not show up until the request has been approved by obofoundry.org)\n\n### Editors' version\n\nEditors of this ontology should use the edit version, [src/ontology/cdno-edit.owl](src/ontology/cdno-edit.owl)\n\n## Citing the CDNO\n\nPlease use this GitHub repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/Southern-Cross-Plant-Science/cdno/issues) to request new terms/classes or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.\n\nIf you use the ontology, please cite its IRI:\u00a0[http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cdno](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cdno)\n\nIf you mention CDNO in a paper, please cite one of the following:\nAndr\u00e9s\u2010Hern\u00e1ndez, L., Baten, A., Azman Halimi, R., Walls, R., & King, G.

  "readme_contents": "# ONS - The Ontology for Nutritional Studies\n\nThe multidisciplinary nature of nutritional studies is one of its main strengths, but at the same time, a major obstacle for integrated data analysis, especially for the terminological and sematic interpretations that specific research fields or communities are used to. To date, a proper ontology to structure and formalize the concepts used for the description of this type of studies is still lacking.\n\nWe have developed the Ontology for Nutritional Studies (ONS) by harmonizing selected pre-existing de facto ontologies with novel health and nutritional terminology classifications as the result of a scholarly consensus of 51 research centers in 9 European countries. The resulting ontology classes and relations are commonly encountered while conducting, storing, harmonizing, integrating, describing and searching nutritional studies. ONS stands out as a single knowledge entry-point of unified and standardized domain-specific conceptual entitles, improving on the process of describing and specifying complex nutritional studies as demonstrated with two application scenarios.\n\nONS is the first systematic effort providing a solid and extensible formal ontology framework for nutritional studies, where integration of new information can be easily achieved by the addition of extra modules (i.e. Nutrigenomics, Metabolomics, Nutrikinetics, Quality appraisal, etc.). Nutritional researchers who might not necessarily be familiar with ontologies and concept standardization, can find in ONS a single knowledge entry point for a unified and standardized terminology for their studies. \n\n\nONS has lately joined the international initiative [International Food Ontology Work Group](https://github.com/FoodOntology/joint-food-ontology-wg); an initiative aimed at connecting various researchers and ontology developers in the broader-sense food domain to collaboratively build consensus on terms and classification in the food domain. Inside the IFOWG's [issue tracker](https://github.com/FoodOntology/joint-food-ontology-wg/issues), terms are discussed and changes are proposed. Eventually, those changes can be adopted by the single ontologies in the IFOWG. \n\nONS was chosen to be the modeling of diet related terms, which were partially already included in V1.0. In the very next future, stemming from discussion in the IFOWG, a series of terms will be de-novo included in ONS and for some terms, definitions or axiomes will be modified. To assure treacability, double issues will be opened on the ONS and on the IFOWG tracker, but the core discussion would be taking place in the latter.\n\n## Contributions and documentation\n\nWe encourage the collaborative extention of ONS and to simplify the process we constantly monitor the ONS repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/enpadasi/Ontology-for-Nutritional-Studies/issues) for requests of new terms/classes or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.\n\nThere is also avaialbe a [Wiki](https://github.com/enpadasi/Ontology-for-Nutritional-Studies/wiki) documenting synthentically but clearly how to start working on the ontology either on your own or via [issue tracker](https://github.com/enpadasi/Ontology-for-Nutritional-Studies/issues).\n\n## Accessibility/Ontology browsers\n\nBioPortal http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ONS  \n\nOBO Foundry: http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/ons.html\n\nOntobee: http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/ONS\n\nFAIRsharing https://fairsharing.org/bsg-s001068\n\nThe ONS ontology has been circulating as a \"work-in-progress\" research artifact with few development versions.

  "readme_contents": "[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/IBM/watson-calorie-counter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/watson-calorie-counter)\n\n# Create a calorie counter mobile app using Watson Visual Recognition\n\nIn this Code Pattern, we will create a calorie counter mobile app using Apache Cordova, Node.js and Watson Visual Recognition. This mobile app extracts nutritional information from captured images of food items.\n\nCurrently this mobile app only runs on Android, but can be easily ported to iOS.\n\n![Architecture diagram](doc/source/images/architecture.png)\n\n## Flow\n\n1. User interacts with the mobile app and captures an image.\n2. The image is passed to the server application which uses Watson Visual Recognition Service to analyze the images and Nutritionix API to provide nutritional information.\n3. Data is returned to the mobile app for display.\n\n## Included components\n\n* [Watson Visual Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html): Visual Recognition understands the contents of images - visual concepts tag the image, find human faces, approximate age and gender, and find similar images in a collection.\n\n## Featured Technologies\n\n* Mobile: Systems of engagement are increasingly using mobile technology as the platform for delivery.\n* [Nutritionix API](https://developer.nutritionix.com/): The largest verified database of nutrition information.\n* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): An asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, designed to build scalable applications.\n\n# Watch the Video\n\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Jp_9hKoNYrM/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Jp_9hKoNYrM)\n\n# Steps\n\n> NOTE: The Watson Visual Recognition service required for this patten only exists in the US-South/Dallas region (as of 11/30/18). You will only be able to deploy and/or use this code there.\n\nThis Code Pattern contains several pieces. The app server communicates with the Watson Visual Recognition service. The mobile application is built locally and run on the Android phone.\n\n## Deploy the Server Application to IBM Cloud\n\n[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy/button.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-calorie-counter)\n\n1. Press the above ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button and then click on ``Deploy``.\n\n2. In `Toolchains`, click on `Delivery Pipeline` to watch while the app is deployed.\n\n![Toolchain pipeline](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)\n\n3. To see the app and services created and configured for this Code Pattern, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app is named `watson-calorie-counter` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wcc-` prefix:\n    * wcc-visual-recognition\n\n> Note: Make note of the `watson-calorie-counter` URL route - it will be required for later use in the mobile app.\n\nTo complete the installation, perform the following steps:\n\n1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)\n2. [Obtain a Nutritionix API ID and key](#2-obtain-a-nutritionix-api-id-and-key)\n3. [Update config values for the Mobile App](#3-update-config-values-for-the-mobile-app)\n4. Perform either 4a or 4b.\n\n    4a. [Install dependencies to build the mobile application](#4a-install-dependencies-to-build-the-mobile-application)\n\n    4b. [Run mobile application build in Docker container](#4b-run-mobile-application-build-in-docker-container)\n\n5. [Add Android platform and plug-ins](#5-add-android-platform-and-plug-ins)\n6. [Setup your Android device](#6-setup-your-android-device)\n7. [Build and run the mobile app](#7-build-and-run-the-mobile-app)\n\n## 1. Clone the repo\n\nClone the `watson-calorie-counter` repo locally. In a terminal, run:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-calorie-counter.git\n$ cd watson-calorie-counter\n```\n\n## 2. Obtain a Nutritionix API ID and key\n\nNutritionix data is used to gather nutritional information of an analyzed image. Instructions for obtaining a key can be found at [Nutritionix.com](https://developer.nutritionix.com/).\n\n> Note: Make note of the API ID and key - they will be required for later use in the mobile app.\n\n## 3. Update config values for the Mobile App\n\nEdit `mobile/www/config.json` and update the setting with the values retrieved previously.\n\n```javascript\n\"BLUEMIX_SERVER_URL\": \"<add-bluemix-server-url>\",\n\"NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID\": \"<add-nutritionix-app-id>\",\n\"NUTRITIONIX_APP_KEY\": \"<add-nutritionix-app-key>\"\n```\n\n## 4a. Install dependencies to build the mobile application\n\nBuilding the mobile application requires a few dependencies that you can either manually install yourself, **or** you can use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) by skipping to [Run mobile application build in Docker container](#4b-run-mobile-application-build-in-docker-container)\n\n### Using manually-installed dependencies\n\nFor this Code Pattern, you'll need to install the prerequisites, by following their respective documentation:\n\n* [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\n* [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (`npm` version 4.5.0 or higher)\n* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/), which includes Android tools and gives you access to Android SDKs\n* [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html)\n* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)\n\nYou'll need to install the specific SDK appropriate for your mobile device. From `Android Studio`, download and install the desired API Level for the SDK. We are using Android API Level 23 as this is widely supported on most phones as of January, 2018. To do this:\n\n* Launch `Android Studio` and accept all defaults.\n* Click on the `SDK Manager` icon in the toolbar.\n* Navigate to `Appearance & Behavior` -> `System Settings` -> `Android SDK`\n* Select Android API level of your choice (Recommended Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) (API Level 23) and above).\n* Click apply to download and install.\n\n> Note: the `mobile/config.xml` is configured to build for Android API Level 23. Adjust this if you wish to build for a different API:\n```\n<preference name=\"android-targetSdkVersion\" value=\"23\" />\n```\n\nOnce you have completed all of the required installs and setup, you should have the following environment variables set appropriately for your platform:\n\n* `JAVA_HOME`\n* `ANDROID_HOME`\n* `PATH`\n\n> Note: For additonal help setting these environment variables, refer to the  [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.\n\n## 4b. Run mobile application build in Docker container\n\nIf you are running [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), build the mobile app in a Docker container.\n\nEither download the image:\n```\ndocker pull scottdangelo/cordova_build\n```\n\nOr build locally:\n```\n$ cd watson-calorie-counter/mobile\n$ docker build -t cordova_build .\n[truncated output]\nSuccessfully built <image-id>\n```\n\nNow create the following alias for `cordova` and the commands for cordova will run inside the container. Use `cordova_build` in place of `scottdangelo/cordova_build` if you have built the container locally.\n\n```\nalias cordova='docker run -it --rm --privileged  -v $PWD:/mobile scottdangelo:cordova_build cordova'\n```\n\n> Note: the `mobile/config.xml` is configured to build for Android API Level 23. Adjust this if you wish to build for a different API:\n```\n<preference name=\"android-targetSdkVersion\" value=\"23\" />\n```\n\n## 5. Add Android platform and plug-ins\n\nStart by adding the Android platform as the target for your mobile app.\n\n```\n$ cd watson-calorie-counter/mobile\n$ cordova platform add android\n```\n\nEnsure that everything has been installed correctly:\n\n```\n$ cordova requirements\n```\n\nFinally, install the plugins required by the application:\n\n```\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file-transfer\n```\n\n## 6. Setup your Android device\n\nIn order to run the application on your Android device, you will need to be prepared to transfer the application's `.apk` file to your device (created in the next step). There are multiple ways for developers to achieve this.\n\nAndroid Studio will handle the transfer for you if you tether your Android device to your computer, and enable both `developer options` and `web debugging`.\n\n> Note: Please refer to documentation on your specific phone to set these options.\n\nFor Mac users, [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) will facilitate simple file transfers between your computer and Android device.\n\n## 7. Build and run the mobile app\n\n```\n$ cd watson-calorie-counter/mobile\n$ cordova build android\n```\n\nAn `.apk` file should appear at `watson-calorie-counter/mobile/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`, which contains the Android application.\n\nYou can then either manually transfer the `.apk` to your device and run it yourself, or if your device is tethered (as described in the previous step), then you can run:\n\n```\n$ cordova run android\n```\n\nHowever, a Docker container does not have access to your host's USB devices, unless you explicitly allow them to be passed through. You can expose your device to the Docker container, and allow Cordova to do the transfer for you. To accomplish that, you'll need to know which USB device to pass through. Discover your USB devices on a Linux machine with `lsusb`.\n\nFor example, in this case, I know that my Android device is `Bus 001, Device 002`:\n\n```\n$ lsusb\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 046d:082d Logitech, Inc. HD Pro Webcam C920\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 18d1:4ee6 Google Inc.\nBus 001 Device 005: ID 046d:c085 Logitech, Inc.\nBus 001 Device 004: ID 045e:02e6 Microsoft Corp.\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n```\n\nI can then pass my device through to the container using `--device=/dev/bus/usb/<bus-number>/<device-number>` and allow Cordova to access it. The new alias for the cordova command would then be:\n\n```\nalias cordova='docker run -it --rm --privileged  --device=/dev/bus/usb/001/002 -v $PWD:/mobile scottdangelo:cordova_build cordova'\n```\nThen we can run:\n```\ncordova run android\n```\n\nAt this point, the app named `Calorie Counter` should be on your mobile device. Use the camera icon to take a photo of a food item, and allow Watson to analyze the image and fetch the calorie results.\n\n# Sample Output\n\n<img src=\"doc/source/images/output1.jpg\" width=\"250\">  <img src=\"doc/source/images/output2.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n* `cordova run android` error: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE]\n\n> The `Calorie Counter` app is already installed on your phone and incompatible with the version you are now trying to run. Uninstall the current version and try again.\n\n* `cordova run android` error: No target specified and no devices found, deploying to emulator\n\n> Ensure that your phone is plugged into your computer and you can access it from the Android File Transfer utility (see Step #6 above).\n\n* How to determine proper values for environment variables:\n\nOpen `Android Studio` and navigate to `File` -> `Project Structure` -> `SDK\nLocation`. This location value will serve as the base for your environment variables. For example, if the location is `/users/joe/Android/sdk`, then:\n\n```\n$ export ANDROID_HOME=/users/joe/Android/sdk\n$ export ANDROID_SDK_HOME=/users/joe/Android/sdk/platforms/android-<api-level>\n$ export PATH=${PATH}:/users/joe/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/users/joe/Android/sdk/tools\n```\n\n* Error: Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: {\"description\"=>\"Only one free key is allowed per organization. Contact your organization owner to obtain the key.\"}\n\n> Only one free key is allowed per organization. Binding the service to an application triggers a process that tries to allocate a new key, which will get rejected. If you already have an instance of Visual Recognition and an associated key, you can bind that instance to your application or update the API key in your server code to tell the app which key to use.\n\n* When using Docker, first `cordova` command fails with:\n```\n-bash: cordova: command not found\n```\n\n> Test that you have the proper alias with:\n```\nalias |grep cordova\n```\nIf you do not see the `alias cordova=...` output from [4b](#4b-run-mobile-application-build-in-docker-container), re-execute the `alias` command above.\n\n# Links\n\n* [Demo on Youtube](https://youtu.be/Jp_9hKoNYrM): Watch the video.\n* [Watson Node.js SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk): : Visit the Node.js library to access IBM Watson services.\n* [Sample code](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/cc-sample-code-image-classification-watson-node/index.html): Identify objects in an image with the Watson Visual Recognition service.\n\n# Learn more\n\n* **Artificial Intelligence Code Patterns**: Enjoyed this Code Pattern?

  "readme_contents": "# nutritionR\nA wrapper for the Nutritionix API (https://www.nutritionix.com), allowing nutritional analysis of foods and recipes expressed in natural language.\n\n# Requirements\n\nRequires a Nutritionix API key (it's free!). Go to https://developer.nutritionix.com\n\n# Installation / getting started\n\n1. Install the package\n\n```\ndevtools::install_github(\"tylerburleigh/nutritionR\")\n```\n\n2. Load the package and set your API keys\n\n```\nlibrary(\"nutritionR\")\nSys.setenv(NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID = \"MY_APP_ID\")\nSys.setenv(NUTRITIONIX_API_KEY = \"MY_API_KEY\")\n```\n\n# How do I use `nutritionR`?\n\nThis package has two functions:\n\n## 1. `nutritionix_lookup()`\n\n`nutritionix_lookup()` takes a natural language food query as input, it sends this query to the Nutritionix API, and then returns an list object with all sorts of nutrition information. \n\nYou can inspect this object. It has all sorts of information like portion size, quantity, weight, brand name (if applicable), and of course nutrition. If you don't specify a portion size or quantity, it will make its own assumptions. You can see what these assumptions are.\n\nFor example, let's say you wanted to query Nutritionix with \"A hamburger with cheese\":\n\n```\nobj <- nutritionix_lookup(\"A hamburger with cheese\")\n```\n\n## 2. `nutrient()`\n\n`nutrient()` takes a nutrition object returned by `nutritionix_lookup()` and a nutrient as input, and returns the information about that nutrient. Specifically, it returns the name, amount, and unit. \n\nFor example, let's say you wanted to know how many calories were in your query \"A hamburger with cheese\".\n\n```\nobj <- nutritionix_lookup(\"A hamburger with cheese\")\nnutrient(obj, \"calories\")\n\n$name\n[1] \"calories\"\n\n$amount\n[1] 653.26\n\n$unit\n[1] \"kcal\"\n```\n\n# Natural language, what?\n\nThe Nutritionix API uses natural language processing to process your queries. It can usually figure out what food items you're referring to even when you give it a complex input with non-food related details. For example, let's say you had eggs and toast for breakfast, and a burrito for lunch. You can use this query exactly as it is:\n\n```\nobj <- nutritionix_lookup(\"I had eggs and toast for breakfast, and a burrito for lunch.\")\nnutrient(obj, \"calories\")\n\n$name\n[1] \"calories\"\n\n$amount\n[1] 569.1\n\n$unit\n[1] \"kcal\"\n```\n\nHere, `nutritionix_lookup()` returns a list object with 3 items, and `nutrient(obj, \"calories\")` returns the calories for all of the ingredients summed together.\n\n# Using `nutritionR` for recipes\n\nYou can use `nutritionR` to lookup nutrition info for recipes. \n\nFor example, this is one of my favorite simple curry recipes:\n\n- 2 cups dry red lentils\n- 2 tsps turmeric\n- 4 tbsp olive oil\n- 2 tsps cumin seeds\n- 1 small onion\n- 2 cloves garlic\n- 2 fresh green chiles\n- 1 tsp garam masala\n- 1 tsp ground coriander\n- 1 tbsp fresh ginger\n- 2 medium tomatoes\n\nIf I want to know the nutrition of this recipe, I can take these ingredients and enter them as a query to the `nutritionix_lookup()` function, as a comma-separated string like this:\n\n```\nobj <- nutritionix_lookup(\"2 cups red lentils, \n                           2 tsps turmeric, \n                           4 tbsp olive oil, \n                           2 tsps cumin seeds, \n                           1 small onion, \n                           2 cloves garlic, \n                           2 fresh green chiles, \n                           1 tsp garam masala, \n                           1 tsp ground coriander, \n                           1 tbsp fresh ginger, \n                           2 medium tomatoes\")\nnutrient(obj, \"calories\")\n\n$name\n[1] \"calories\"\n\n$amount\n[1] 2022.532\n\n$unit\n[1] \"kcal\"\n```\n\nLet's say I want to know the calories per serving. If I know how many servings the recipe makes, then I could divide the `amount` returned by `nutrient()` by the number of servings.\n\n```\nobj <- nutritionix_lookup(\"2 cups dry red lentils, \n                           2 tsps turmeric, \n                           4 tbsp olive oil, \n                           2 tsps cumin seeds, \n                           1 small onion, \n                           2 cloves garlic, \n                           2 fresh green chiles, \n                           1 tsp garam masala, \n                           1 tsp ground coriander, \n                           1 tbsp fresh ginger, \n                           2 medium tomatoes\")\ncalories <- nutrient(obj, \"calories\")\ncalories$amount / 6\n\n[1] 337.0887\n```\n\n# Great, so what nutrients can I lookup?\n\nCurrently, 68 nutrients are supported. \nThis includes macronutrients like fat, protein, carbs, calories, and also micronutrients, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nThe full list of nutrients is as follows:\n\n- calcium\n- carbohydrate\n- cholesterol\n- calories\n- saturated fat\n- fat\n- trans fat\n- iron\n- fiber\n- potassium\n- sodium\n- protein\n- sugar\n- vitamin d\n- alanine\n- alcohol\n- arginine\n- ash\n- aspartic acid\n- caffeine\n- carotene alpha\n- carotene beta\n- choline\n- cryptoxanthin\n- copper\n- cystine\n- monosaturated fat\n- polysaturated fat\n- folate\n- folic acid\n- folate\n- glutamic acid\n- glycine\n- histidine\n- isoleucine\n- leucine\n- lutein and zeaxanthin\n- lycopene\n- lysine\n- methionine\n- magnesium\n- manganese\n- niacin\n- phosphorus\n- pantothenic acid\n- phenylalanine\n- proline\n- retinol\n- riboflavin\n- selenium\n- serine\n- theobromine\n- thiamin\n- threonin\n- vitamin e\n- tryptophan\n- tyrosine\n- valine\n- vitamin a\n- vitamin b12\n- vitamin b-6\n- vitamin c\n- vitamin d2 and d3\n- vitamin k\n- water\n- zinc\n\nThis list can also be accessed with `data(nutrients)`\n\n\n# Package maintainer / author\n\nnutritionR is written and maintained by [Tyler Burleigh](https://tylerburleigh.com).\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=tylerburleigh\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/tylerburleigh?style=social&logo=twitter\" alt=\"follow on Twitter\"></a>\n"

Use them so that when a user clicks on the button, it adds them on a list on the right called \"_Today's foods_\".\n\nYou will also need to display the total amount of calories at the bottom of the list as a recap.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fH0dyqpPJRvTbiF5rJ/giphy.gif)\n\nIf you don't remember how to create responsive columns with Bulma, you can check the [documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/columns/basics/).\n\n### Iteration 6 | Bonus | Group ingredients\n\nYou made an awesome application, but you have found a little problem in the UX. For example, if you click twice on \"Pizza\", it will display 2 lines \"_1 Pizza = 400 cal_\" instead of 1 line \"_2 Pizza = 800 cal_\". Fix that problem.\n\n### Iteration 7 | Bonus | Allow the user to remove an ingredient\n\nOn the \"_Today's food_\", add a trash icon to let users removing one of their items.\n\nHappy coding! :heart:\n"

  "language": "Python",
  "readme_contents": "# Nutrition-Optimization-New\nThis repo implements a linear program solver to create an optimal diet based on a large database of foods and nutritional content. I originally created this program in attempt to optimize my own health, and have been happily eating a program-recommended chili 5 days a week since March of 2019! Nutritional data was obtained by downloading the database files from the [USDA's Food Composition Database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html). This dataset contains nutritional content information for over 9000 foods and over 100 nutrients. Nutritional guidelines were estimated for a 25 year-old male based on [health.gov](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-7/) and [The National Academies Press dietary references](https://www.nap.edu/read/11537/chapter/33).  \n\nHere's an example diet output by the program:\n![ex_foods](ex_foods.PNG)\n![ex_nutrients](ex_nutrients.PNG)\n\n\nThe nuts and bolts of how to run the code are detailed below. It is a bit clunky to work with as it relies on inputing nutrient and food constraints into two separate excel csv files. Sorry :(\n\n- data_parse.py is used to convert the USDA's Food Composition Database .csv files into a more human-readable form, where each row of the CSV represents a food and each column represents a nutrient.\n\n- linear_solver.py is used to formulate the task of selecting a diet with optimal nutritional content as a linear program. Nutritional minimums and maximums are input as constraints to the program, and the objective function seeks to minimize the overall weight of selected foods. As of now, the mechanism for interacting with the solver is a bit clunky, and I am still thinking of a more elegant way to input constraints, etc. \n\n- In the food_exclusions.xlsx file, the first column indicates whether the food should be included at all in the optimization. The second column indicates whether the food's weight should count towards the objective function. The solver will attempt to use only foods that do not count towards the overall weight first, so one can easily specify a set of base ingredients that the solver will always attempt to use first. The third and fourth columns specify the minimum and maximum allowable weight of that food in the solution.\n\n- In the nut_constraints.xlsx, the first and second columns correspond to the daily min and max values for each nutrient.\n\n- All nutritional content values can be viewed in data_chart.xlsx\n\n- To generate a diet, modify the nut_constraints and food_exclusions files, then run linear_solver.py. A diet will be output indicating the weight of each food included in the diet as well as the overall nutritional content of the diet.\n\n- This repository isn't really in a finished state yet, but if you're interested in using it, let me know and I'll be happy to answer any questions to get it up and running for you!\n"

  "readme_contents": "# React | Nutrition\n\n## Introduction\n\nYou just realized that lately your diet is not healthy and it may have an impact on your health (and productivity), now and in the long term. \n\nTo take care of the food you eat, you decided to create a nutrition app that will track everything you eat!\n\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fH0dyqpPJRvTbiF5rJ/giphy.gif)\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Fork this repo\n- Clone this repo\n\n## Submission\n\n- Upon completion, run the following commands:\n\n  ```\n  git add .\n  git commit -m \"done\"\n  git push origin master\n  ```\n\n- Create Pull Request so your teacher can check up your work.\n\n## Instructions\n\n\n### Import a JSON\n\nImport the foods from the `foods.json`.\n\n```js\nimport foods from './foods.json'\n```\n\n\n## About the design\n\nIf you struggle with the design, you can find a static example of what is expected inside file `style-guides.html` in the `starter-code` folder.\n\nSo let's start: \n\n### Iteration 1 | Create `FoodBox` component\n\nCreate a `FoodBox` component that takes at least `food` as a prop and displays a box with all the information about an ingredient.\n\nYou can use this HTML snippet to display properly the `FoodBox`:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bY9i5Rw.png)\n\n\n### Iteration 2 | Display food\n\nIn your `App` component (your main component), display as many `FoodBox` as elements inside the variable `foods`.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3TVQJDO.png)\n\n\n\n### Iteration 3 | Add new food\n\n\nCreate a button to add new foods.\n\nWhen a user clicks the button, a form will appear with fields for a name, number of calories, and an image.\n\nWhen the user clicks submit, the food will be added to the list.\n\nThe form should disappear when the user clicks the submit button.\n\n\n### Iteration 4 | Implement search bar\n\nCreate a `Search` component to perform a search that updates the list of all meal. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XaOpAx8.png)\n\n\n\n### Iteration 5 | Create add buttons\n\nOn your `FoodBox`, you have an input an \"+\" button. Use them so that when a user clicks on the button, it adds them on a list on the right called \"*Today's foods*\".\n\nYou will also need to display the total amount of calories at the bottom of the list as a recap.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fH0dyqpPJRvTbiF5rJ/giphy.gif)\n\nIf you don't remember how to create responsive columns with Bulma, you can check the [documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/columns/basics/).\n\n\n### Iteration 5 | Bonus | Group ingredients\n\nYou made an awesome application, but you have found a little problem in the UX. For example, if you click twice on \"Pizza\", it will display 2 lines \"*1 Pizza = 400 cal*\" instead of 1 line  \"*2 Pizza = 800 cal*\". Fix that problem.\n\n\n### Iteration 6 | Bonus | Allow the user to remove an ingredient\n\nOn the \"*Today's food*\", add a trash icon to let users removing one of their items.\n\n\nHappy coding! :heart:\n"

In this paper, we used computer vision techniques to facilitate the dietary assessment process by detecting foods from images. We used the Food-101 dataset which consists of 101 classes and developed a model that uses a \ufb01ne-tuned model of InceptionV3 and get 85% top-1 accuracy. In this process, we tried different Models, Activation Functions, LossFunctions, Dropouts, LearningRates, Batch Sizes. We observed the model\u2019s behavior in each of those conditions and tried to get the best case possible. Our results show that the InceptionV3 which is a CNN model can be a good choice for identifying Foods by using Food-101 Dataset.\n\n# Our Medium Blogs:\n\nYou can access this project's medium blogs from here: <br />\nWeek 1: https://medium.com/bbm406f19/deepnutrition-be-aware-of-your-macronutrients-c47497c423cc  <br />\nWeek 2: https://medium.com/bbm406f19/week-2-deepnutrition-be-aware-of-your-macronutrients-131dc0389e8 <br />\nWeek 3: https://medium.com/bbm406f19/week-3-deepnutrition-be-aware-of-your-macronutrients-e3cd3f01a9f7 <br />\nWeek 4: https://medium.com/bbm406f19/week-4-deepnutrition-be-aware-of-your-macronutrients-aaecce8b330e <br />\nWeek 5: https://medium.com/bbm406f19/week-5-deepnutrition-be-aware-of-your-macronutrients-f6f36dc070a0 <br />\nWeek 6: https://medium.com/bbm406f19/week-6-deepnutrition-be-aware-of-your-macronutrients-54abd178148 <br />\n\n# Our Team\nAli Kayadibi (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-kayadibi-a1a262147/), <br />\nIsmet Okatar (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismetokatar/), (https://github.com/ismetokatar) <br />\nMuhammed Aydogan (https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammed-aydogan-22b31b179)\n"

No matter how long the grocery list, precise nutritional details are displayed for every food item in order to help us make smart, conscious decisions about our daily nutrition.\n## How I built it\nTo build it, we used Expo.io (React-Native) to offer cross-platform mobile support. We used the Google Cloud Platform tools for our machine learning and part of our backend, and used Heroku with Node.js for the rest of our backend. NutritionIX API was used for up-to-date nutritional info.\n## Challenges I ran into\nSome challenges we faced included:\n1. Grocery receipts were not standardized amoung any grocery stores so we needed a way to parse the receipts in a way so that results were still consistent amoung different sellers. Also, a lot of items are abbreviated in grocery receipts so searching up the exact item was hard.\n2. Not everyone on the team was familiar with the stack we used, so it was difficult learning a new language/framework while trying to work with it to use the APIs.\n3. The data we received from the API's we used would not always be consistent due to the nature of our product. We had to come up with algorithms and implementations that were robust enough to handle errors due to inconsistencies from certain API calls.\n## Accomplishments that I'm proud of\nWe are proud that we integrated each part that we worked on into one big, working product. We worked with technologies that were not all familiar to us but we read through enough docs and examples to learn what we needed to succeed.\n## What I learned\nSince we all had different experiences, we specialized in certain tasks, depending on our background. Even so, we learned a lot of things from using the APIs, integrating each component of our project into one working product, and working with new technologies.\n## What's next for NutritionIQ\nWe would love to add support for recipe recommendations based on the ingredients that were parsed from the receipt. Also, we could extend our app to be a health-tracker with users' food and nutritional data stored on the server. We could also recommend what foods to buy in order to meet our daily nutritional requirements.\n"

In the scope of this project, I'm considering valuable resources to be those from which you learn a lot, those which are packed with ideas you find surprising.\n\n[Read more...](https://paulbricman.com/thoughtware/lexiscore)\n\n# Installation\n\n**Note**: This tool requires a running instance of the [conceptarium](https://paulbricman.com/thoughtware/conceptarium) as a proxy for your knowledge.\n\nThe lexiscore labeler can either be deployed from source or using Docker.\n\n### Docker\n\nTo deploy the lexiscore labeler using Docker, first make sure to have Docker installed, then simply run the following.\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8501:8501 paulbricman/lexiscore \n```\n\nThe tool should be available at `localhost:8501`.\n\n### From Source\n\nTo set up the lexiscore labeler, clone the repository and run the following:\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\nstreamlit run main.py\n```\n\nThe tool should be available at `localhost:8501`.\n\n# Screenshots\n\n![](https://paulbricman.com/assets/img/lexiscore_mockup.png)\n![](https://paulbricman.com/assets/img/lexiscore_mealprep.png)\n"

  "readme_contents": "Here is the basic gist of this application. This is a testing ground for me to build a gem that imports the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference  (http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8964). The text version of the database is in a none conventional format, delimitated by a '^' and surrounded by '~'s. \n\nThis application has 12 models that match the 12 tables in the Nutrient Database. These models are used to import the data that is parsed from the \"ASCII\" form of the database. The actual format of the text files are 'windows-1251'.\n\nIn the lib/tasks directory there is a rake task file that will parse the Nutrient Database ASCII files, found lib/data directory.\n\nThere is a task called 'process_data', it will run the parse method from the 'parse_usda.rb' file. This file will convert the USDA text files to a conventional 'CSV' file. Each file is then imported into its matching table using a CSV reader.\n\nThe tasks require the 12 models to already be created in a local database. There are 12 migration files in the 'db' directory. These will help you create the models you need.\n\nIf you have any questions please email me at bcmehrman@gmail.com\n\n\n "
