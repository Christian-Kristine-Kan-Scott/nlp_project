# Natural Language Processing Project 

## This file/repo contains information related to our nlp project, using scraped data from git hub repositories


## Project Goals
Our overall goal is to identify key words among a variation of REPOs on Guthub and create a model to predict what programming language that a repository is based on the text included in the README files.

## Project Description
In this project, we will utilize the text in README files of x repositories that relate to health, explore initial questions and find common words that have a correlation to various programming languages.  We will use machine learning to create a classification model that predicts what programming language a repository is, depending on what text is included in the README file.


## The Plan



 
## Initial Questions

- What are the most common words in READMEs?

- What does the distribution of IDFs look like for the most common words?

- Does the length of the README vary by programming language?

- Do different programming languages use a different number of unique words?

| Variable          | Description                            |Data types|
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |----------|
|                   |                                        |          |
|                   |                                        |          |
|                   |                                        |          |
|                   |                                        |          |
|                   |                                        |          |
