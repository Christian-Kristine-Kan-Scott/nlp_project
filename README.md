# Natural Language Processing Project 

## This file/repo contains information related to our nlp project, using scraped data from git hub repositories


## Project Goals
Our overall goal is to identify key words among a variation of REPOs on Guthub and create a model to predict what programming language that a repository is based on the text included in the README files.

## Project Description
In this project, we will utilize the text in README files of x repositories that relate to health, explore initial questions and find common words that have a correlation to various programming languages.  We will use machine learning to create a classification model that predicts what programming language a repository is, depending on what text is included in the README file.


## The Plan

**Plan - Acquire - Prepare - Explore - Model - Deliver**

- Wrangle
    - Acquire data via webscraping Github through class provided script
    - Prepare data by creating basic clean functions such as tokenize, removing stopwords, lemmatize
    - We will create a function that we can reference later to acquire and prepare the data by storing the function in a file name wrangle.py
    - We will split our data to a train, validate, and test
- Explore
    - Create visualizations of data to pin point key text words that correllate to programming languages
    - Create a visualizations correlating to hypotheses statements
    - Run at least two statistical tests that will support whether the hypothesis has been rejected or not
- Modeling
    - Establish baseline
    - Ensure models are tested on appropriate validate and test datasets
    - Determine best performing model and test on test dataset
- Delivery
    - README with project details
    - Python modules with acquire and prepare functions
    - Final Report in Jupyter Notebook
    - Presentation with slide show entailing executive summary details





 
## Initial Questions

- What are the most common words in READMEs?

- What does the distribution of IDFs look like for the most common words?

- Does the length of the README vary by programming language?

- Do different programming languages use a different number of unique words?

|                   |                                        |          |
|                   |                                        |          |
|                   |                                        |          |
|                   |                                        |          |
